TIMESYNC PTP Stack
===================

Note:
----
- This is the sample Precise Time Protocol (PTP) demo stack provided by Texas Instruments only to showcase the time synchronization of local Ordinary-clock with a PTP Master clock.
- Only Ordinary Clock functionality is being tested, with "P2P" delay mechanism (IEEE802.3 protocol packet).
- This stack middleware code is not tested for performance, neither we intend to support this going forward.
- Considering as a demo stack, Texas Instruments does not claim to actively develop this stack and hence would not be able to support this stack code.
