/*
 * Global Load Feature :
 *      Many Applications will have EPWMs with runtime updates to their 
 * CMP/TBPRD/Action Qualifier/ DeadBand Registers etc, that affect 
 * the EPWM Outputs. Care needs to be taken while updating these registers 
 * so that there wouldn't be any incorrect/unexpected/corrupted waveforms 
 * while these updates happen. To tackle with such issues, the EPWMs have 
 * been equipped with a Global Load feature. 
 *      Along with the Shadow to Active load strobe for individual register sets, 
 * there is optional Global load strobe, if enabled, overwrites the local load 
 * strobe. The global load strobe can be used for activating all shadow 
 * to active transfers, this will result in retaining the older EPWM outputs 
 * untill all the shadow registers are updated, resulting in no currupted 
 * waveforms in between. 
 * 
 * Link Feature :
 *      Link Feature helps link the EPWMs to have simultaneous updates to 
 * the link enabled registers like TBPRD/CMP(A/B/C/D)/DBFED/DBRED/GLDCTL2, when
 * these registers in the linked EPWMs are written to.
 * 
 * Example Description :
 *      This Example aims to showcase the Global Load and Link features usage.
 * 4 EPWMs, 
 *  - CONFIG_EPWM_NO_GLD            : no Global Load is configured 
 *  - CONFIG_EPWM1_GLD              : Global Load is configured.
 *  - CONFIG_EPWM2_GLD_LINK_SELF    : Global Load is configured. 
 *                                    CMP(A/B)/ GLD Controls Linked to self 
 *  - CONFIG_EPWM3_GLD_LINK_EPWM2   : Global Load is configured. 
 *                                    CMP(A/B)/ GLD Controls Linked to 
 *                                    CONFIG_EPWM2_GLD_LINK_SELF.
 * 
 * Apart from the Global load or Link configurations, all EPWMs are configured 
 * similarly. Check the Syscfg for the Global Load Configurations and differences.
 * 
 * Note : 
 *      Shadow registers are used for CMP, TBPRD regs, while global load is only 
 * used on the CMP regs and Link is used for CMP and GLD controls. 
 * 
 * External Connections.
 *      Probe the EPWM outputs for the above EPWMs and Status pin.
