/*
 * Example Description
 *  This example configures EPWM0, EPWM1, epEPWM2 to produce signal of desired
 * frequency and duty. It also configures phase between the configured
 * modules.
 *
 * Signal of 10kHz with duty of 0.5 is configured on ePWMxA & ePWMxB
 * with ePWMxB inverted. Also, phase of 120 degree is configured between
 * EPWM0 to EPWM2 (EPWM2 to EPWM4 in case of AM261x-LP) signals.
 *
 * During the test, monitor EPWM0, EPWM1, and/or EPWM2 (EPWM2, EPWM3 and/or
 * EPWM4 in case of AM261x-LP) outputs on an oscilloscope.
 *
 * On AM263x CC/ AM263Px CC with HSEC Dock,
 * Probe the following on the HSEC pins
 *  - EPWM 0A/0B : 49 / 51
 *  - EPWM 1A/1B : 53 / 55
 *  - EPWM 2A/2B : 50 / 52
 *
 * On AM263x LP/ AM263Px LP,
 * Probe the following on boosterpack
 *  - EPWM 0A/0B : J4 11 / J8 59
 *  - EPWM 1A/1B : J2 37 / J2 38
 *  - EPWM 2A/2B : J2 39 / J2 40
 * 
 * On AM261x LP,
 * Probe the following on boosterpack
 *  - EPWM 2A/2B : J2 40 / J8 39
 *  - EPWM 3A/3B : J2 38 / J2 37
 *  - EPWM 4A/4B : J2 36 / J2 35
