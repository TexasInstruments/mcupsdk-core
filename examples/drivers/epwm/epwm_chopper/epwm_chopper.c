/*
 * Chopper Submodule 
 *  The PWM chopper submodule allows a high-frequency carrier signal to modulate
 * the PWM waveform generated by the action-qualifier and dead-band submodules. 
 * This capability is important if pulse transformer-based gate drivers to 
 * control the power switching elements are needed.
 * 
 * Key Funcitonalities include...
 *  - Programmable chopping (carrier) frequency 
 *  - Programmable pulse width of first pulse
 *  - Programmable duty cycle of second and subsequent pulses
 *  - Can be fully bypassed if not required

 * Example Description :
 *  this example demonstrates the Chopper functionality of EPWM. 
 * Configurations
 * 1. EPWM 0 (EPWM_NO_CHOPPER) (EPWM2 in case of AM261x-LP)
 *  - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
 *  - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 * 
 * 2. EPWM 1 (EPWM_CHOPPER_1_8TH) (EPWM3 in case of AM261x-LP)
 *  - Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
 *      - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
 *      - Chopper Duty Cycle : 1/8
 *  - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 * 
 * 3. EPWM 2 (EPWM_CHOPPER_6_8TH) (EPWM4 in case of AM261x-LP)
 *  - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
 *      - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
 *      - Chopper Duty Cycle : 2/3
 *  - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 * 
 * 4. EPWM 3 (EPWM_CHOPPER_4_8TH_WITH_DB) (EPWM6 in case of AM261x-LP)
 *  - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
 *      - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
 *      - Chopper Duty Cycle : 1/2
 *  - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 *  - DeadBand added.
 *      - output A is RED with 50 EPWM TBCLKs
 *      - output B is FED with 50 EPWM TBCLKs
 * 
 * External Connections
 * 1. Probe EPWM 0A (EPWM2A in case of AM261x-LP) for Reference waveform 
 * 2. Probe EPWM 1A,2A,3A,3B (EPWM3A, EPWM4A, EPWM6A, EPWM6B in case of AM261x-LP) for the Chopper enabled waveforms.
 * 
 * On AM263x CC/ AM263Px CC with HSEC Dock, 
 * Probe HSEC pins 49,53,50,54,56 respectively for EPWM 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B
 * 
 * On AM263x LP/ AM263Px LP,
 * Probe J4 11, J2 37, J2 39, J6 77, J6 78 respectively for EPWM 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B
 * On AM261x LP,
 * Probe J2 40, J2 38, J2 36, J6 78, J6 77 respectively for EPWM 2A, 3A, 4A, 6A and 6B
