/*
 * A CMPSS example that enables the CMPSS High comparator and feeds the
 * asynchronous output to GPIO and EPWM
 
 * This example enables the CMPSSA0 COMPH comparator and feeds the asynchronous
 * CTRIPOUTH signal to the XBAROUT0 pin and CTRIPH to EPWM0B.
 * 
 * CMPSS is configured to generate trip signals to trip the EPWM signals.
 * CMPIN1P is used to give positive input and internal DAC is configured 
 * to provide the negative input. Internal DAC is configured to provide a
 * signal at VDD/2. An EPWM signal is generated at EPWM0B and is configured
 * to be tripped by CTRIPOUTH.
 * 
 * When a low input(VSS) is provided to CMPIN1P,
 *     - Trip signal(XBAROUT0) output is low
 *     - EPWM0B gives a PWM signal
 * 
 * When a high input(higher than VDD/2) is provided to CMPIN1P,
 *     - Trip signal(XBAROUT0) output turns high
 *     - EPWM0B gets tripped and outputs as high
 * 
 * External Connections \n
 *  - Give input on CMPIN1P (ControlCard HSEC Pin 12)
 *  - Outputs can be observed on 
 *    - XBAROUT0 (SOC pin QSPI0_CSN1. USER_LED1 on ControlCard) 
 *    - and EPWM0B (ControlCard HSEC pin 51) using an oscilloscope
