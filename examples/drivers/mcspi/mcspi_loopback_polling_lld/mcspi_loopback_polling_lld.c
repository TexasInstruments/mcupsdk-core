/* This example demonstrates the McSPI RX and TX operation configured
 * in blocking, interrupt mode of operation.
 *
 * This example sends a known data in the TX mode of length APP_MCSPI_MSGSIZE
 * and then receives the same in RX mode. Internal pad level loopback mode
 * is enabled to receive data.
 * To enable internal pad level loopback mode, D0 pin is configured to both
 * TX Enable as well as RX input pin in the SYSCFG.
 *
 * When transfer is completed, TX and RX buffer data are compared.
 * If data is matched, test result is passed otherwise failed.
