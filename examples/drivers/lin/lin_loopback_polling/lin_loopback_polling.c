/*
 *   This example configures the LIN module in master mode for internal
 *   loopback without interrupts. The module is setup to perform 8 data
 *   transmissions with different transmit IDs and varying transmit data.
 *   Waits for reception of an ID header. The received data is then checked
 *   for accuracy.
 *
 *   External Connections:
 *   - None.
 *
 *  Watch Variables:
 *   - txData - An array with the data being sent
 *   - rxData - An array with the data that was received
 *   - result - The example completion status (PASS = 0xABCD, FAIL = 0xFFFF)
