/*
 * Example Description:
 *      The DAC Shadow value syncs to DAC Active Value from EPWM Event. 
 * The EPWM Peripheral can send out a EPWMSYNCPER signal, on certain events,
 * (check syscfg, under timebase submodule for more details on events) which
 * may be used by the DAC peripheral to sync its shadow to active register 
 * transfers.
 *      The example showcases this in the EPWM ISR, where the event for sync
 *  signal and the event for the interrupt are same. now, if there is a new
 * shadow value set, it wouldn't reflect in the active until the next ISR
 * iteration. and similarly, the last set shadow value would appear in the 
 * active register of the DAC.
 * 
 * Note that, the events for EPWMSYNCPER signal and the Interrupt signal from 
 * EPWM are not dependant, in other words, the EPWMSYNCPER may be configured
 * without the need to configure the INT signal from the EPWM. 
 * 
 * Configurations
 *      DAC loadmode is set to the EPWM SYNC PER signal.
 *      EPWM SYNCPER signal is generated at its counter equals to period event
 *
 * External connections
 *      The status Pin, EPWM output A, DAC output may be probed to view the 
 * waveforms
 *          - On AM263x-CC or AM263Px-CC, with HSEC dock,
 *              - Probe the HSEC Pin 9 for DAC output.
 *              - Probe the HSEC Pin 49 for EPWM A output.
 *              - Probe the HSEC Pin 51 for STATUS (GPIO 44) output.
 *          - On AM263x-LP or AM263Px-LP,
 *              - Probe the J3 Pin 30
 *              - Probe the J4 Pin 11 for EPWM A output.
 *              - Probe the J8 Pin 59 for STATUS (GPIO 44) output.
