This Non-Disclosure Agreement For the Receipt of TI Security Information (“Security NDA”) is a legal agreement between you and Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”). In this Security NDA “you” means you personally if you will exercise the rights granted for your own benefit, but it means your company (or you on behalf of your company) if you will exercise the rights granted for your company’s benefit. By downloading, copying or otherwise using the Security Information you agree to abide by the provisions set forth herein. This Security NDA is displayed for you to read prior to downloading the Security Information. If you choose not to accept or be bound by these provisions, do not download or use the Security Information.

3.	Confidentiality Period. You must protect the Security Information against disclosure as long as you retain it. If you return the Security Information to TI, or destroy the Security Information, your duty to protect the Security Information shall survive until seven (7) years after you have returned to TI, or destroyed, the Security Information (and all copies) and provided to TI your written certification of such return or destruction.  For the avoidance of doubt, your right to use the Security Information terminates upon termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement.

4.	Term and Termination. This Security NDA is effective on the date the Security Information is delivered to you together with this Security NDA and will remain in full force and effect until terminated. Either party may terminate this Security NDA upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party. At any time TI shall have the right to request the return of the Security Information disclosed under this Security NDA.  You shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving TI’s written request, return the Security Information and all copies made thereof including all documents and other materials containing the Security Information, or at TI’s option, certify in writing that all Security Information and documents and other materials containing any Security Information have been destroyed.

5.	The following paragraphs shall survive the termination, cancellation or expiration of this Security NDA: 3-5, 6-14, 16, and 17.

6.	Limited Disclosure.  Only the following parties are authorized to receive Security Information, and only to the extent these parties are bound by a confidentiality agreement with you that is no less restrictive than this Security NDA:

(a)	your employees with a need to know; and

(b)	your on-premises contractors with a need to know.


You shall be responsible for any disclosure or use contrary to the terms of this Security NDA made by any such employees or on-premises contractors, as if you itself had engaged in such unauthorized disclosure or use.

7.	Covenant not to Sue.  During the term of this Security NDA, you agree not to assert a claim against TI that the Security Information infringes your intellectual property rights.

8.	Restrictions. You shall protect the Security Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as you use to protect your own similar confidential information of like importance and to prevent any dissemination to unauthorized third parties or other use not permitted herein.  You shall not provide Security Information to any internal business organization or group, subsidiary, or third party that designs or manufactures semiconductors unless TI gives prior written consent.

9.	Exceptions. This Security NDA imposes no obligation upon you with respect to Security Information received hereunder which:
(a)	was already known to you without a duty of confidentiality;
(b)	is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of yours;
(c)	is rightfully received by you from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; or
(d)	is independently developed by you.

If you are required to disclose Security Information to a government body or court of law, you agree to give TI sufficient advance written notice to enable TI the opportunity to contest the disclosure or to obtain a protective order.

10.	No Warranty. THE SECURITY INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS." TI MAKES NO WARRANTIES UNDER THIS SECURITY NDA, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. YOU AGREE TO (1) USE YOUR INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN DEVELOPING YOUR PRODUCTS AND (2) TO TAKE ALL STEPS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF YOUR PRODUCTS AND ANY ASSOCIATED DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS.  NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECURITY NDA WILL BE CONSTRUED AS A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY TI TO MAINTAIN PRODUCTION OF ANY TI DEVICE OR OTHER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THE SECURITY INFORMATION MAY BE USED.

IN NO EVENT SHALL TI OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS SECURITY NDA OR THE USE OF THE SECURITY INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT WILL TI’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECURITY NDA OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SECURITY INFORMATION EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$500).

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

These remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies that TI may have at law or in equity.  Failure by TI to enforce any provision of this Security NDA shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision in this Security NDA or any other agreement that may be in place between the parties.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY TI WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.

NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSTRUED AS A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY TI TO MAINTAIN PRODUCTION OF ANY TI DEVICE OR OTHER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THE LICENSED MATERIALS MAY BE USED.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LICENSED MATERIALS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED OR CERTIFIED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR INDUSTRY REGULATORY ORGANIZATION OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION. YOU AGREE TO USE YOUR INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN DEVELOPING YOUR PRODUCTS. YOU AGREE THAT PRIOR TO USING OR INCORPORATING OR DISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED MATERIALS IN OR WITH ANY COMMERCIAL PRODUCT THAT YOU WILL THOROUGHLY TEST THE PRODUCT AND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS IN OR WITH THAT PRODUCT AND BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR FAILURES.

CERTAIN LICENSED MATERIALS MAY BE PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS. PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS DO NOT REPRESENT A FINAL AND GENERALLY AVAILABLE VERSION OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, AND MAY BE UNDERGOING TESTING AND FURTHER MODIFICATION BY TI. THE PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS ARE NOT AT THE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE AND COMPATIBILITY OF A FINAL RELEASE VERSION.

IN NO EVENT WILL TI OR TI'S LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCLUDED DAMAGES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, COST OF REMOVAL OR REINSTALLATION, OUTSIDE COMPUTER TIME, LABOR COSTS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF SAVINGS, OR LOSS OF USE OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS. IN NO EVENT WILL TI'S OR TI'S LICENSORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$500).

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to You.

8.	Data Collection and Sharing. The Licensed Materials may monitor and collect technical data and other information related to Your use of the Licensed Materials, Your computer system or device, and related activity. You hereby agree and acknowledge that TI may freely use and share that information and data (including with or through its affiliates, partners, and service providers) to, among other things, support the Licensed Materials, use to make improvements or enhancements to the Licensed Materials, and develop, promote, support, and enhance TI products and offerings.

9.	Security.

a.	Security. Neither TI nor its licensors will be liable or responsible in any way if unauthorized persons gain access to, copy, change, delete, or damage data, information, applications, code, functions, features, or operation of the Licensee Products. You are responsible for properly configuring and using TI Devices or Licensed Materials and taking Your own independent steps to maintain appropriate security and protection of Your Licensee Products and any associated data from unauthorized access.

b.	Security Keys. If the Licensed Materials are used to embed security keys in TI Devices via e-fusing, this provision applies. You may not use development keys in production. You are solely responsible for evaluating the adequacy of, selecting, obtaining, or generating any keys that may be used in Licensee Products, including obtaining all necessary rights, licenses, and authorizations in and to those keys. TI is not responsible for the integrity, operation, or security of Your keys in TI Devices or their use in Licensee Products, or for the consequences of third parties using, gaining access, overcoming or bypassing such keys. You accept that use of the Licensed Materials to e-fuse (or to attempt to e-fuse) security keys into the TI Devices permanently alters them and, consequently, TI will have no liability (warranty or otherwise) for any such altered TI Devices.

10.	High-Risk Applications.

a.	Safety-Critical Applications. Licensed Materials promoted for safety applications are designed and intended to assist You in Your efforts to develop and create applications that comply with the requirements of certain safety standards. However, Your use of the Licensed Materials does not ensure that Your application will meet the requirements of such safety standards or that it will qualify for certification to any particular safety standard. Furthermore, You remain responsible for using Your knowledge and independent judgment to determine the requirements for performance and testing of Your applications as may be (i) required to meet applicable state, national, international and regulatory safety standards, or (ii) required or recommended by functional safety standards.
