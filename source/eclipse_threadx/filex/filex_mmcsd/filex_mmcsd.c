    /* There are several useful/important pieces of information contained in the media
       structure, some of which are supplied by FileX and others are for the driver to
       setup. The following is a summary of the necessary FX_MEDIA structure members:

            FX_MEDIA Member                              Meaning

        fx_media_driver_request             FileX request type. Valid requests from FileX are
                                            as follows:

                                                    FX_DRIVER_READ
                                                    FX_DRIVER_WRITE
                                                    FX_DRIVER_FLUSH
                                                    FX_DRIVER_ABORT
                                                    FX_DRIVER_INIT
                                                    FX_DRIVER_BOOT_READ
                                                    FX_DRIVER_RELEASE_SECTORS
                                                    FX_DRIVER_BOOT_WRITE
                                                    FX_DRIVER_UNINIT

        fx_media_driver_status              This value is RETURNED by the driver. If the
                                            operation is successful, this field should be
                                            set to FX_SUCCESS for before returning. Otherwise,
                                            if an error occurred, this field should be set
                                            to FX_IO_ERROR.

        fx_media_driver_buffer              Pointer to buffer to read or write sector data.
                                            This is supplied by FileX.

        fx_media_driver_logical_sector      Logical sector FileX is requesting.

        fx_media_driver_sectors             Number of sectors FileX is requesting.


       The following is a summary of the optional FX_MEDIA structure members:

            FX_MEDIA Member                              Meaning

        fx_media_driver_info                Pointer to any additional information or memory.
                                            This is optional for the driver use and is setup
                                            from the fx_media_open call. The RAM disk uses
                                            this pointer for the RAM disk memory itself.

        fx_media_driver_write_protect       The DRIVER sets this to FX_TRUE when media is write
                                            protected. This is typically done in initialization,
                                            but can be done anytime.

        fx_media_driver_free_sector_update  The DRIVER sets this to FX_TRUE when it needs to
                                            know when clusters are released. This is important
                                            for FLASH wear-leveling drivers.

        fx_media_driver_system_write        FileX sets this flag to FX_TRUE if the sector being
                                            written is a system sector, e.g., a boot, FAT, or
                                            directory sector. The driver may choose to use this
                                            to initiate error recovery logic for greater fault
                                            tolerance.

        fx_media_driver_data_sector_read    FileX sets this flag to FX_TRUE if the sector(s) being
                                            read are file data sectors, i.e., NOT system sectors.

        fx_media_driver_sector_type         FileX sets this variable to the specific type of
                                            sector being read or written. The following sector
                                            types are identified:

                                                    FX_UNKNOWN_SECTOR
                                                    FX_BOOT_SECTOR
                                                    FX_FAT_SECTOR
                                                    FX_DIRECTORY_SECTOR
                                                    FX_DATA_SECTOR
