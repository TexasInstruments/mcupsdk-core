 * @subsection xxx Overview
 *
 * CSL CPTS API  has common implementation for multiple SoCs along with below SoC specific
 * implementation with the mapping as below.
 *      -# cpsw/V0 - SOC_K2K/SOC_K2H
 *      -# cpsw/V1 - SOC_K2E/SOC_K2L
 *      -# cpsw/V2 - SOC_K2G
 *      -# cpsw/V4 - SOC_C6678
 *      -# cpts/V0 - SOC_AM65XX
 *
 * @note: there may not be any ip specific implementation for that soc, if it contains only cslr_* files
 *
