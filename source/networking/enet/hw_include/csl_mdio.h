 * @subsection xxx Overview
 * 
 * CSL_MDIO_API  has common implementation for multiple SoCs along with below SoC specific
 * implementation with the mapping as below.
 *      -# mdio v0 - SOC_K2H/SOC_K2K/SOC_C6678
 *      -# mdio v1 - SOC_K2E/SOC_K2L
 *      -# mdio v2 - SOC_AM574x/SOC_AM572x/SOC_AM571x/SOC_DRA72X/SOC_DRA75X/SOC_DRA78X
 *      -# mdio v3 - SOC_C6657/SOC_OMAPL137/SOC_OMAPL138
 *
 * @note: there may not be any ip specific implementation for that soc, if it contains only cslr_* files
