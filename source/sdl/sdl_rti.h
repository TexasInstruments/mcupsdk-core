 * The Digital Watchdog Timer(DWT) generates reset after a programmable period,
 * if not serviced within that period. In DWT, time-out boundary is configurable.
 * In DWWD, along with configurable time-out boundary, the start time boundary is also configurable.
 * The DWWD can generate Reset or Interrupt, if not serviced within window(Open Window) defined by start time and time-out boundary.
 * Also the DWWD can generate Reset or Interrupt if serviced outside Open Window (within Closed Window). Generation * of Reset or Interrupt depends on the DWWD Reaction configuration.
