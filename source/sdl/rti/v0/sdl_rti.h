 *
 *    The Digital Watchdog Timer(DWT) generates reset after a programmable
 *    period, if not serviced within that period. In DWT, time-out
 *    boundary is configurable.
 *    In DWWD, along with configurable time-out boundary, the start time
 *    boundary is also configurable. The DWWD can generate Reset or
 *    Interrupt, if not serviced within window(Open Window) defined by
 *    start time and time-out boundary. Also the DWWD can generate Reset or
 *    Interrupt if serviced outside Open Window (within Closed Window).
 *    Generation of Reset or Interrupt depends on the DWWD Reaction
 *    configuration.
