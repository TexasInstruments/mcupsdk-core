/**
 *  \brief PBIST self test
 *
 *  This function executes a PBIST self test of the specified type for a
 *  specific PBIST instance. The test types supported are defined in
 *  SDL_PBIST_testType.
 *  PBIST is a feature that is used for self test of the memory regions
 *  in the SoC. Multiple instances may be supported.
 *  Note: The PBIST test is destructive to the cores/IP which are being
 *  tested. Therefore it should be executed from a different core than
 *  the one under test.
 *  It is important to note that execution of PBIST self-tests require
 *  preparation of the IPS under test by bringing them to a certain
 *  power and reset state before executing the test. The application
 *  must take care of this sequence before executing the self-test.
 *  The SDL examples give a reference for the necessary sequences.
 *  The PBIST instances supported are specific to the SoC, and are
 *  defined in the soc-specific header file.
 *
 *  \param instance         [IN]  PBIST instance
 *  \param testType         [IN]  PBIST test type to run.
 *  \param timeout          [IN]  Max number of times to check for PBIST done
 *  \param pResult          [OUT] Pointer to variable to indicate result
 *
 *  \return The SDL error code for the API.
 *                                 If pResult is NULL: SDL_EBADARGS
 *                                 If testType is invalid: SDL_EBADARGS
 *                                 If other error happened: SDL_EFAIL
 *                                 Success: SDL_PASS
