 *
 *  \brief This file contains the internal defines for configuring interrupt
 *         support for the ARM Cortex-R5 and VIM
 *
 *  The following is the recommended calling sequence for this API:
 *
 *  1. Call Intc_Init() to initialize the interrupt support
 *  2. For each interrupt you wish to enable...
 *     a. Call Intc_IntSetSrcType() to set interrupt type (level or pulse)
 *     b. Call Intc_IntPrioritySet() to set the interrupt priority (0-15) and
 *        mapping (IRQ or FIQ)
 *     c. Call Intc_IntRegister() to register the interrupt
 *     d. Call Intc_IntEnable() to enable the interrupt
 *  3. Call Intc_SystemEnable() to enable the R5 IRQ and FIQ interrupts
 *
 *  When an interrupt occurs, control goes to the ISR given as a parameter
 *  in the Intc_IntRegister() call for that specific interrupt. The pending
 *  interrupt is automatically cleared and acknowledged in the VIM.
 *
 *  Other calls available:
 *  o Call Intc_IntUnregister() to unregister a previously registered interrupt
 *  o Call Intc_IntDisable() to disable a previously enabled interrupt
 *  o Call Intc_SystemDisable() to disable the R5 IRQ and FIQ interrupts
