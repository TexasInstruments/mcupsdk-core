 * \brief User callback that is invoked when a message is received from a reote core for a given client ID
 *
 * Before invoking the API, the IPC module would have 'popped` the message from the HW or SW FIFO already.
 * This callback is called frm ISR context, so all constraints of ISR should be applied by the callback,
 * e.g. no blocking wait, quickly handle message and exit ISR.
 *
 * For most applications, it is recommended to put the message value into a local SW queue and defer the
 * message handling itself to a application task.
 *
 * @note
 * This callback will process the *msgValue . Registered function should not be blocking.
 *  as this is called from isr context.
