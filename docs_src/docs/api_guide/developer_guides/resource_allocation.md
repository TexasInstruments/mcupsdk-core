# Modifying resource allocation {#RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_GUIDE}

[TOC]

## Introduction

Various resources of the SOC like the number of DMA channels, number of interrupt router outputs, number of interrupt aggregator virtual interrupt numbers etc. are usually managed by a resource management system or a resource manager.
In the case of AM64x and AM243x devices, this is managed by the System Controller Firmware (SYSFW) running on the M3 core. Once the SYSFW is loaded on M3 and is initialized, we need to send a certain configuration data to the SYSFW regarding the resources we would be using. This is largely an array of resource assignment entries, with each entry specifying the start number of the resource, count or number of resource needed, type of resource, host id of the core which will request for this resource, etc. Later when the request for a specific resource is made, the SYSFW will cross check the request parameters with this already sent configuration data, and the requested resources will only be allocated if that falls within the range in this configuration data. We call this the Resource Management Board Configuration or __RM boardcfg__.

## Changing a particular resource

\note For the make/gmake commands, am243x is taken as an example here to pass for the SOC
argument. Please use the correct SoC name when the commands are run.

- RM Boardcfg is stored in a C file `{SDK_ROOT_DIRECTORY}\source\drivers\sciclient\sciclient_default_boardcfg\{SOC}\sciclient_defaultBoardcfg_rm.c`. Ultimately this file needs to be changed
  and rebuilt for the boardcfg change to take effect.
- This file is autogenerated using a SysConfig based GUI tool (K3 Respart Tool). This tool can be invoked from the commandline. To invoke the tool, run the following from the SDK root directory:
```bash
make -s -C tools/sysfw/boardcfg configure SOC=am243x
```
It should open up the resource management configuration sysconfig window like so:

- Any changes required for any of the resources can be changed using the GUI and doing a File->Save (Ctrl-S) saves it to a *.syscfg file
  inside the tool.

- Once you have identified for which host you need to assign resources to, and the resource type which you want to modify,
  click on that particular host to see the currently assigned resources.

- Here is the host id to core mapping:

- You can decrease/increase the number of resources.There are hard
  restrictions to certain resources. As long as your assignments are within the
  restrictions, you can change the configuration in the way which suits your
  application. The tool will throw an error if any of resources exceed their
  allowed number.

- Resources can be shared between hosts, but at most 2 hosts can have the same resource.
  To share a resource, a resource sharing entry needs to be added in the GUI tool.

- After the resource is shared, it will show up as an info under the resource.

- To generate the actual C file from this config file, run the following from the
  SDK root directory once you have saved the config in GUI:
```bash
make -s -C tools/sysfw/boardcfg configure-gen SOC=am243x
```

- That should update the `{SDK_ROOT_DIRECTORY}\source\drivers\sciclient\sciclient_default_boardcfg\{SOC}\sciclient_defaultBoardcfg_rm.c` file.

## Rebuilding the board configuration

- Once the changes are made in the file, there are three steps to be followed:
  - Re-build the `sciclient_set_boardcfg` example
  - Re-build the `sciclient_ccs_init` example
  - Re-build the boardcfg binary blob by running the following from SDK root directory:

    ```bash
    make -s -C tools/sysfw/boardcfg sciclient_boardcfg SOC=am243x
    ```

- This makes sure that boardcfg is updated for both SBL and CCS based boot flows.
