# Adding Support For a Custom Flash Device {#CUSTOM_FLASH_SUPPORT_GUIDE}

[TOC]

## Introduction

The flash driver in the SDK is supposed to work based on a configuration structure passed
on the driver during the initialization time. This configuration structure has been chosen
to support the configuration models of a number of flashes from multiple vendors.
Currently, this configuration is generated by SysConfig from the options provided
in the SysConfig Flash Module. This guide details the steps to bring up a custom
flash using these tools and methods provided in the SDK. In a later version a method
will be provided to do this without SysConfig as well.

The QSPI interface present in the SOC can support only the 1S-1S-1S mode or the
1S-1S-4S modes for reading from the flash.

The configuration structure can be obtained albeit automatically if the flash
supports SFDP (Serial Flash Discoverable Parameter) table.

### Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters (SFDP)

The Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters (SFDP) is a standard which provides a
consistent method of describing the functional and feature capabilities of the
flash device in a standard set of internal parameter tables. This table can be
queried to identify the configurations and adjustments needed to set the flash
in a desired state.

The parsing of the SFDP table is time consuming. Considering this, the SFDP parsing
feature in this SDK is tied with a diagnostic example of the QSPI driver. In flashes
where the SFDP is supported, this example can be used to parse the details into a
config structure which can aid bringing up the custom flash. As of now the SFDP
parsing in the SDK supports upto JEDS216D standard.

## Summary of steps needed to enable a new flash device

 - **Step 1**: Build the `qspi_flash_diag` example : \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_QSPI_FLASH_DIAG.
 This example communicates with the flash in 1S-1S-1S mode and queries the flash for the
 SFDP table (if SFDP is supported by the flash) among other things. The logs from
 this example would be required later to configure the flash driver.

 - **Step 2**: Open the SysConfig GUI for the example/application you want to try
 with your flash and enter the details manually using the flash datasheet or using
 the JSON from `qspi_flash_diag` log. Save this SysConfig configuration.

Now you can test your example/application with the new flash device! Also test the
configuration with QSPI bootloader \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_SBL_QSPI and flash writer
\ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_SBL_UART_UNIFLASH by flashing an example \ref GETTING_STARTED_FLASH.
Let's get into the details of the steps.

## Step 1: Building the QSPI Flash Diagnostic example

Refer the example page \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_QSPI_FLASH_DIAG on building this application.
\cond !SOC_AWR294X
You will need have to initialize the SOC in no boot mode as mentioned in \ref EVM_SOC_INIT_NOBOOT_MODE
and also load and run this example using CCS, as mentioned in \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE.
\endcond
Building and running the QSPI Flash Diagnostic example is important because regardless
of flash supporting SFDP or not, the diagnostic example gives a basic sanity for the
flash. If the flash diagnostic doesn't work, there could be HW connection issues most
probably. When you successfully build and run the example, you should get a log with
json data like this:

\code

            "strDtrCfg": null
        },
        "p118": null,
        "p444s": null,
        "p444d": null,

}
\endcode

You will see this
if your flash supports SFDP. In this case, copy this part save it as JSON file,
this would be useful in Step 2. In fact, the TI Board Default Flash configuration
is also saved as json.

## Step 2: Configuring the flash via SysConfig

\imageStyle{flash_syscfg_gen.png, width:30%}
\image html flash_syscfg_gen.png "Flash SysConfig Module GUI"

As you can see in the above image, there are various configurations options
available for the flash.

- Start with setting the `Flash Device` as custom flash instead of TI Board Default
Flash.

- Enter the name of your flash part in the next configurable and select the protocol
from the next drop down. If the required protocol is not supported, there is also
an option to choose the data lines for CMD, ADDR and DATA sections of the flash datagram.

Rest of the configuration depends on whether the flash supports SFDP or not.

### Case 1: Flash Supports SFDP

If your flash supports SFDP and the `qspi_flash_diag` example is able to print out
the SFDP table as shown in Step 1, configuring the flash in your example via SysConfig
is quite easy.

\imageStyle{auto_cfg.png, width:30%}
\image html auto_cfg.png "Flash Auto Config"

- To use the JSON file, scroll down to the section which says "Automatically Configure Flash".
Now click on the `LOAD FROM JSON` button which will open a file dialog.

- Browse to the JSON file saved in Step 1 and select it. SysConfig should "load"
data from the file into the GUI.

- You can cross verify the values with datasheet if required, but mostly this won't
be necessary.

### Case 2: Flash Doesn't Support SFDP

If your flash doesn't support SFDP, the flash configuration details would need to
be filled in manually. This can be a pain point, but mostly flashes without SFDP
support wouldn't have a lot of configuration as well. Only basic things like quad
bit enable, etc would need to be looked up in the datasheet.

Most of the configurables should be self explanatory. Still if some terms seem
confusing, look for a question mark icon near the configurable when you hover.
Clicking on that should give the long description regarding a certain configurable.

### Case 3 (Rare Scenario): Flash Supports SFDP, but Protocol Configuration is Custom

We have tried to keep an interface as generic as possible. But because of the
variety of flash vendors and configurations, sometimes setting a protocol might
differ from the sequences listed in SysConfig interface. Sometimes there might be
extra steps required during the initialization for the flash to function correctly.
To tackle this issue, we have given the option of two hooks:

 - Custom Protocol Function
 - Quirks Function

The custom protocol hook will be invoked in the middle of the Flash_open function
and the quirks function will be invoked at the end of the Flash_open function.

You would find these options in the SysConfig GUI for flash under the protocol
configuration after you've selected your protocol as __"Custom Protocol"__.
The quirks function is always present as the last configurable.

\imageStyle{quirks.png, width:30%}
\image html quirks.png "Custom Protocol and Quirks Function Hooks"

You should leave these as `NULL` if your flash doesn't need this.

## Obtaining flash details from the SFDP table OR datasheet

This section can be ignored if the flash supports SFDP.

All the details regarding the flash including fast read opcodes, supported erase sizes,
dummy clocks needed for each instruction and flash configuration registers information
will be available from the flash data sheet.

- Flash size, page size and block size can be obtained from the introduction/overview
section of the datasheet.

- The read, write, register read, register write, read ID and other opcodes can
be obtained from "Transaction tables". There will be transaction tables for each
protocol (For example 1S-1S-1S transaction table, 1S-1S-4S transaction table)

- The number of dummy cycles required for the read opcodes will also be available
from the transaction table.

- 3 byte addressing can work if you are accessing upto the 16 MB. If the flash size
is more than that 4 byte addressing mode should be used

- Check the datasheet to see if 4 byte addressing mode is supported. There are multiple
ways flash devices support 4 byte addressing mode. In most cases, the flash will have
separate set of opcodes for 4 byte addressing mode. Sometimes there will be a
configuration register which can be set so that flash switches to 4 byte addressing mode.

- QE bit setting is one of the most important settings in 1-1-4 protocol. Usually
it is part of the SR2 and is non-volatilewritable. But this can change, and as of
JEDS216D there are 7 different types of Quad Enables possible!

## Miscellaneous Debugging Tips and Tricks

- Sometimes if there is a data mismatch or data showing up with one-off bytes
(usually in high speed octal transactions), it is advisable to check the dummy cycles,
if the controller and flash are in agreement with the same. In 1-1-4 or QSPI protocol,
8 dummy cycles for read is a given, but cross check with the datasheet and provide
correct value in the flash sysconfig.
