# Enabling Secure Boot {#SECURE_BOOT}

[TOC]

## Secure Devices and Secure Boot: An Introduction

To put it simply, **secure boot** refers to booting application images in a secure way. Secure boot is a feature/service available in **secure devices**.
\cond SOC_AM243X || SOC_AM64X
Out of the device types **GP** and **HS**, HS device type can do secure boot. In secure devices there are two subtypes:
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM261X
 In secure device types (HS) there are two subtypes:
\endcond

1. Field Securable (FS)
2. Security Enforced (SE)

HS device type have FS and SE subtypes. Out of the two subtypes, FS and SE, this guide talks about secure boot in an **HS-SE** device. If the secure device received is an **HS-FS** subtype, it needs to be converted to an HS-SE variant with the customer keys burnt into the device eFUSEs. This is done using a special piece of software called an OTP keywriter. Keywriter documentation is out of scope for this guide.

## Secure Boot Process

Secure boot process, like the normal boot, consists of two stages - ROM loading and SBL loading. ROM loading is when the boot ROM loads the HSM runtime binary onto the HSM core, and the signed SBL binary into the primary boot core, which in most cases is an ARM Cortex R5F. SBL loading is when the SBL reads the signed application image from a boot media, authenticates it, decrypts it, and boots it. Here we describe how the secure process takes place in an HS-SE device.

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM243X || SOC_AM64X
\note In AM243x/AM64x devices, the HSM runtime binary mentioned is the System Firmware (SYSFW) and HSM core is the DMSC Cortex M3 core. Hereafter for generality sake we'll use the terms 'HSMRt' and 'HSM core' but understand that for AM64x/AM243x this means the SYSFW and Cortex M3 core.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AM261X
## Keyring Support
The keyring is a set of keys which can be imported by SBL after importing the HSM runtime binary on an **HS-SE** device. For importing keyring TIFS-MCU expects an X.509 certificate signed by customer active root of trust (MPK). If X.509 certificate is containing symmetric keyring extension, the symmetric keyring blob must be encrypted with active root key. For certificate generation script usage, see \ref KEYRING_CERT_GEN_PYTHON_SCRIPT.

TIFS-MCU supports application authentication using the following algorithms with Keyring.

## Secure Boot Support in SDK

### Device configuration file

To make the secure/non-secure differences seamless for the user, a configuration file is provided at `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/devconfig/devconfig.mak`.
In this configuration file, you can set certain options like the device type, keys to be used for signing and encryption etc. By default they will point to the dummy customer MPKs and MEKs but if you're using a production device with your own keys, please change the paths here to point to the right key files. Configuration of this file is currently manual, this will be made configurable by a GUI in an upcoming release.

The devconfig.mak file looks something like this:

### Signing tool

For signing the binaries, two different scripts are used:

1. ROM signing script - This is a python script used for signing the SBL. The x509 certificate template used in this script is expected by the ROM.
2. Application signing script - This is a python script used for signing the application image. The x509 certificate template used in this script is expected by the HSMRt.

 For more details on the usage of the script, see \ref TOOLS_BOOT_SIGNING

### Generating Secure Boot Image

#### SBL Image Generation {#SBL_SECURE_IMAGE}

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
In AM64x/AM243x devices, a combined boot method is employed, by virtue of which the SBL, SYSFW and the SYSFW-BoardConfig are combined and signed with the same certificate. This is built into the make system of the SBL applications in the SDK - SBL_UART, SBL_OSPI, SBL_SD, SBL_NULL, etc. So whenever an SBL application is built, the loadable `*.tiimage` will be a concatenation of the x509 certificate, SBL binary, SYSFW binary and the boardcfg binary blob. In case of HS devices, the SYSFW inner certificate will also be concatenated.
\endcond

SBL and HSMRt are signed via Root of trust Keys i.e. SMPK (if keyrev = 1) or BMPK (if keyrev = 2). MCU+ SDK is only tested with TI-Dummy Keys. Users are expected to generate their own set of keys and use the same for production. This is supposed to be used only with the devices with the same dummy customer MPK burnt into the eFUSEes. If the SDK is supposed to be used with a production/development device with actual customer MPKs burnt into the device, please replace the file at ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot/signing/custMpk_${SOC}.pem. This is true for also the encryption key used, which can also be found at ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot/signing/custMek_${SOC}.txt. Whenever any SBL is built, it will be signed with dummy customer MPK, and the signed image generated will have an extension of `*.hs.tiimage`.

For more information, please refer to the OTP Keywriter Documentation.

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX||SOC_AM273X||SOC_aWR294X || SOC_AM261X
\note HSMRt is built with TIFS-MCU package which is an add-on package on MCU+ SDK.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
There is no extra step required other than making sure that the MPK used is indeed the one burnt into the eFUSEs.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM261X
It is recommended to pass a key derivation salt for requesting ROM to not use the
Customer MEK directly but generate a derived key to decrypt the SBL/HSMRt images.
ROM uses HKDF (HMAC based Key Derivation Function) to derive a key from the S(B)MEK.
The Key Derivation Function requires a salt which is a non-secret random value
which it uses in a 2 step HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand process.
For more information, please refer to [RFC-5869](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869).
With the signing scripts provided as part of MCU+ SDK, this can be done by
passing argument `kdsalt` to the signing script and has been
integrated as the default option in the makefiles for SBL.

\note To maintain the longevity of Customer MEK, it is recommended to update the salt
everytime there is a firmware upgrade.

The salt is supplied to the makefiles via the file `/source/security/security_common/tools/boot/signing/kd_salt.txt`.

Here is an example certificate for SBL that takes care of the above recommendation:

\endcode

Note that the salt in encryption extension and key_derivation extension is same.
This is designed so that the same derived key can be used for encrypting application
images. For more information on the different extensions supported by ROM, please
see \ref TOOLS_BOOT_SIGNING.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
\note We have enabled full debug while signing the ROM image. This is intentional as this is helpful for debug. Once moved from development to production please remove this option from the makefile. For more details see \ref TOOLS_BOOT_SIGNING
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM261X
To build SBL image with certificate for HS-SE devices, one can use the following command:
\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
\code
make -s -C examples/drivers/boot/sbl_uart/am263x-cc/r5fss0-0_nortos/ti-arm-clang all DEVICE=am263x DEVICE_TYPE=HS
\endcode
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM273X
\code
make -s -C examples/drivers/boot/sbl_uart/am273x-evm/r5fss0-0_nortos/ti-arm-clang all DEVICE=am273x DEVICE_TYPE=HS
\endcode
\endcond
\cond SOC_AWR294X
\code
make -s -C examples/drivers/boot/sbl_uart/awr294x-evm/r5fss0-0_nortos/ti-arm-clang all DEVICE=awr294x DEVICE_TYPE=HS
\endcode
\endcond
This will add the appropriate extensions as part of the X509 certificate and will
encrypt the image  with Customer MEK as well.
\note To build the same via CCS GUI, update the device type on devconfig.mak and rebuild the SBL.
\note Encryption of SBL images is enabled by default using `ENC_SBL_ENABLED`
flag in devconfig file (which is set as `yes`).
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AM261X
Keyring can be imported in SBL by using keyring import module in sysconfig.
- Add instance of keyring import module in sysconfig.
\imageStyle{keyring_syscfg_1.png,width:50%}
\image html keyring_syscfg_1.png "Keyring Import Module Instance"


- Load the keyring certificate header file which is generated using \ref KEYRING_CERT_GEN_PYTHON_SCRIPT.
\imageStyle{keyring_syscfg_2.png,width:50%}
\image html keyring_syscfg_2.png ""

The sysconfig module auto-generates APIs for keyring import and builds SBL along with keyring certificate.
For certificate generation script usage, see \ref KEYRING_CERT_GEN_PYTHON_SCRIPT.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X | SOC_AM243X
#### Signing the HSM Runtime binary (SYSFW)
As mentioned above, since we follow a combined boot method, SYSFW and SBL is signed with the same certificate using the same key. In case of a GP device this will be a degenerate key for easy parsing from ROM. In the case of an HS device, SYSFW will be already signed with TI MPK (and encrypted). This is then countersigned again with dummy customer MPK during the combined image generation process.
\endcond

#### Secure application image Generation {#APPLICATION_SECURE_IMAGE}

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AM261X
\note 
    * Signing and Encryption steps for **RPRC** and **MCELF** application images are the **same**. 
    * For Signing, the DEVICE and DEVICE_TYPE=HS options must be provided. 
    * For Encryption along with signing, the DEVICE, DEVICE_TYPE=HS and ENC_ENABLED=yes options must be provided.

Depending on the options given in the device configuration file (`devconfig.mak` mentioned above), appimage is generated for HS devices. If encryption is enabled in the configuration file, the binary will be first encrypted with the key specified and then the certificate will be generated using the customer MPK specified. If the device type is set as HS in the configuration file, nothing extra needs to be done for the appimage generation. The final `*.appimage.hs` or `.mcelf.hs` file generated would be signed with private key mentioned in the devconfig (and encrypted with encryption key specifed in devconfig if that option is selected).
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X | SOC_AM243X

The SBL doesn't have innate abilities to do the image integrity check, or verify the SHA512 of the application image. It relies on SYSFW for this. The image is stored in a readable memory and a pointer to the start of the image is passed to the HSMRt with other details like load address, type of authentication etc.

##### RSASSA-PSS Support

The RSASSA-PSS algorithm can be used instead of the default RSA PKCS#1v1.5 signature algorithm by specifying RSASSAPSS_ENABLED=yes and APP_SIGNING_SALT_LENGTH. Maximum supported salt length value for RSASSA-PSS is **255**.

See the command below for reference.

##### Auxiliary Keys Support
\note Sample auxiliary keys are present at location `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/keyring_cert/aux_keys`.
\note RSASSA-PSS algorithm can be used with RSA auxiliary keys.

The auxiliary keys in both symmetric keyring and asymmetric keyring begin at index 32. The application binary can be signed with an auxiliary private key that has the corresponding public key hash in the keyring.
Similarly application binary can be encrypted with auxiliary aes key for which the corresponding aes key is available in the keyring.
The customer must specify the keyring index corresponding to the auxiliary key used for authentication and encyrption.

If imported public key is available at index 38 in keyring for brainpoolp512r1_private.pem,
the application images can be built with the following flags for appending the
X509 certificate for HS-SE devices:

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X

### Encryption support for application images

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
\note
    * Encrypted MCELF application images retain header informations which allows them to be parsed by tools like readelf.
    * Booting Signed + Encrypted application images from Flash is now supported. Please refer to the MCELF QSPI/OSPI SBLs and FASTBOOT QSPI/OSPI SBLs.
    * \ref FAST_SECURE_BOOT
\endcond

Optionally, one can encrypt the application image to meet security goals.
This can be accomplished with adding one more flag ENC_ENABLED with the make command:
\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
\code
make -s -C examples/hello_world/am263x-cc/r5fss0-0_nortos/ti-arm-clang all DEVICE=am263x DEVICE_TYPE=HS ENC_ENABLED=yes
\endcode

## Limitations in Secure Boot

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
- **XIP boot** : Secure boot is yet to be supported for XIP applications. This is due to the fact that the XIP sections are loaded before the SBL parses the other sections. Secure boot of XIP applications will be made available in an upcoming release.
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM243X
- **Decryption of application image size greater than 256kb is not possible in SBL OSPI** : In **am243x-lp** board, in case of booting multicore application only 256KB is available in MSRAM( Please refer \ref MEMORY_MAP). In SBL OSPI the HSM does an in-place authentication and decryption of the image and we load the image directly from the FLASH memory . FLASH memory, as you would know is most often not directly writable. Due to this limitation not being taken care in the HSM, we can do decryption of images only in case where the image resides in a volatile RAM-like memory. So we are copying the image from flash to MSRAM and decrypting the image. Therefore in case of secure boot, the available memory for decrypting the image is 256KB( greater than 256KB can be problematic in multi-core image scenarios).
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM261X
- **Authentication of application image directly from flash in SBL QSPI** : Only authentication of application
image from flash is supported in SBL QSPI. This is susceptible to Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks if Flash is overwritten post-auth.

- **Encryption of application image not supported in SBL QSPI** : In UART bootloader, application image can be encrypted using the `ENC_ENABLED` option in the devconfig.mak. But this is not possible when you load the image using SBL QSPI. This is due to the fact that HSM does an in-place authentication and decryption of the image and we load the image directly from the FLASH memory in case of SBL QSPI. FLASH memory, as you would know is most often not directly writable. Due to this limitation not being taken care in the HSM, we can do decryption of images only in the case where the image resides in a volatile RAM-like memory like OCRAM.

\cond ~SOC_AWR294X
- **Secure Boot is untested on SBL SD and SBL CAN**
\endcond
\cond SOC_AWR294X
- **Currently Secure Boot is supported on SBL_NULL, SBL_QSPI and SBL_UART only**
\endcond
