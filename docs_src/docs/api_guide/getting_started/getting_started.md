#  Getting Started {#GETTING_STARTED}

\attention It is strongly recommended to begin development by following the steps in the order listed below.

\note The steps in this user guide show screen shots and descriptions based on Windows.
      However the steps in Linux would remain the same, unless mentioned otherwise.

\note ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH} refers to the path where the SDK is installed. Recommend to install in
      `C:/ti` in Windows, and `${HOME}/ti` in Linux. To install to other locations, refer \ref INSTALL_NON_DEFAULT

\note `{some text}` refers to a variable string that should be replaced by user and `{some text}` should not be typed verbatim
      on the command prompt.

\note In Windows, use the `cmd.exe` as command prompt and in Linux, use the bash shell as the command prompt.

## Introduction

### Getting Started Goals

On successful completion of below steps, you would have achieved the following
- All tools needed for development are installed
- EVM setup needed for development is verified
- CCS IDE setup needed for development is verified
- One SDK example has been built using makefile as well as CCS project
- One SDK example has been loaded and run on the EVM
- Output console logs on CCS and UART are working as expected
- One SDK example has been flashed to the EVM flash and the application booted from the flash without CCS.

I2C Controller          | I2C device which generates the SCL clock and initiates communication
I2C Target              | I2C device which responds to I2C Controller
LIN Commander           | LIN device which intiates the transfer
LIN Responder           | LIN device which responds to the transfer
PTP Sync Time Source    | Ethernet device that periodically broadcasts the current time as a message to the other clocks
PTP Sync Receiver       | Ethernet device that is waiting for the master to poll for data to actually send it
EtherCAT MainDevice     | EtherCAT device which is allowed to trasfer the data across network
EtherCAT SubDevice      | EtherCAT device which reads the data addressed to them bu MainDevice
Ethernet/IP Scanner     | Ethernet/IP scanned is the client device responsible for establishing a connection path to an EtherNet/IP Adapter
Ethernet/IP Adapter     | Ethernet/IP adapter which receives implicit communication connection requests from an scanner then produces its I/O data at the requested rate. An adapter is also an explicit message server.

### Next Steps

Now you can explore the SDK by running more examples (see \ref EXAMPLES) and browsing through various developer notes (see \ref DEVELOPER_GUIDES), to understand the SDK better and develop your own applications with the SDK.
