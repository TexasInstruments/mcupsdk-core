## IEEE 802.1Qbv EST/TAS {#enet_est_intro_est_tas}

IEEE 802.1Qbv [Time-Aware Shaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-Sensitive_Networking#IEEE_802.1Qbv_Enhancements_to_Traffic_Scheduling:_Time-Aware_Shaper_(TAS)) (TAS), which is also called *Enhancements for
Scheduled Traffic* (EST) in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018, defines a mechanism to allocate
and grant exclusive Ethernet port transmission access on repeating cycles which
are divided into slices where traffic of specific traffic class queues can be
selected for transmission as per use-case requirements.

The diagram below shows a generic EST schedule composed of *n* slices (also
called *time intervals*), each slice has specific *gate mask* that defines the
state of each *transmission gate*: *open* or *closed*.

  \image html EST_Schedule_Diagram.png EST schedule

*Transmission gates* are associated with specific traffic class queues (0-7).
When a gate is *open*, frames from the corresponding queue can be selected for
transmission. When the gate is *closed*, frames from the corresponding queue
will not be selected for transmission.  It's up to the application to determine
the duration of each time slice and the state of each transmission gate.

The list of all gate states for all slices in the cycle is called *gate control
list*.  The control list that is programmed is called *administrative list*,
when list becomes active is then called *operational list*.

For further information about TAS/EST specification, please refer to section *8.6.9
Scheduled traffic state machines* of IEEE 802.1Q-2018 standard document.


## Guard band {#enet_est_intro_guard_band}

It's worth noting that in EST, the transmission of a frame will not be interrupted,
the full frame transmission will be completed even if it spills over the next
time slice.  This could pose a problem when traffic from the previous time slice,
potentially of lower priority, spills over the next time slice meant for higher
priority traffic.

A [guard band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-Sensitive_Networking#IEEE_802.1Qbv_in_more_detail:_Time_slices_and_guard_bands), which is a time slice with all gates closed, can be added right before
critical time slices to ensure that wire is cleared of any previous traffic.
The duration of the guard band must be set long enough for a packet of MTU size
that initiated transmission right before the non-critical time slice ended had
been fully transmitted.

# Enet LLD API {#enet_est_api}

Enet LLD provides support for TAS/EST through the IOCTLs described in the
\ref ENET_MOD_TAS API Guide.  The most important IOCTLs are listed below:

- \ref ENET_TAS_IOCTL_SET_STATE. Sets the state of TAS module for each MAC port:
    - \ref ENET_TAS_RESET to reset the state machine.
    - \ref ENET_TAS_ENABLE to start EST/TAS after a valid administrative list
      has been programmed.
    - \ref ENET_TAS_DISABLE to stop  (idle) EST/TAS.

- \ref ENET_TAS_IOCTL_SET_ADMIN_LIST. Sets a new administrative list of type
  \ref EnetTas_ControlList.  The gate control list is composed of:
    - [baseTime]. The administrative base time which determines when the
      administrative list will become active.
         - The base time can be set to a timestamp in the past, in which case
           the administrative list should become active right away.
         - The base time can also be set to a timestamp in the future, but note
           that not all Ethernet peripherals may fully support this feature.
    - [gateCmdList]. The actual gate control list defined as list of *time
      interval duration* and *gate state mask* pairs.  Enet LLD supports up to
      16 intervals for simplicity, though some Ethernet peripherals
      may support larger number of intervals.
    - [listLength]. The number of entries in the gate
      control list.
    - [cycleTime]. The repeating cycle time.
         - If it's larger that the accumulated time of all the intervals in the
           control list, the last time interval gets *extended* till end of the
           cycle.
         - If it's shorter than the accumulated interval time, then the gate
           control list gets *truncated* as per cycle time.
    - [sduTable]. The maximum service data unit (SDU) per queue.

- \ref ENET_TAS_IOCTL_GET_OPER_LIST_STATUS. Gets the status of the operational
  list update.  It must be called after a new operational list has been set
  until driver acknowledges that the operational list has been updated by
  returning \ref ENET_TAS_OPER_LIST_UPDATED.

- \ref ENET_TAS_IOCTL_GET_OPER_LIST_STATUS. Gets the current operational list.
  It must be called after valid administrative list has been programmed.
  The operational list is a structure of type \ref EnetTas_ControlList which
  is the same type used for administrative lists describer earlier.

[baseTime]:    \ref EnetTas_ControlList::baseTime
[gateCmdList]: \ref EnetTas_ControlList::gateCmdList
[listLength]:  \ref EnetTas_ControlList::listLength
[cycleTime]:   \ref EnetTas_ControlList::cycleTime
[sduTable]:    \ref EnetTas_ControlList::sduTable

The call sequence in the following diagram illustrates the typical usage of
Enet LLD IOCTLs to configure EST/TAS on a given MAC port.

# CPSW Support {#enet_est_cpsw}

\if (SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX)

## CPSW EST Driver Implementation {#enet_est_cpsw_driver}

The EST functionality in CPSW is implemented in Enet LLD through two of its Enet LLD
modules: CPTS and MAC port.

- Each Ethernet port has an **EST function generator (ESTF)** in the CPTS hardware
  module, this is used to program the EST *cycle time*.
- Each Ethernet transmit port has 128 locations in the CPSW global **EST Fetch RAM**
  which is used to program the EST *gate control list*.  The EST RAM is programmed
  with *fetch commands* which are composed of *fetch count* (time slice duration)
  and *fetch allow* (gate mask).

The following diagram shows the EST schedule and the relevant CPSW components.

  \image html Cpsw_EST_Schedule_Diagram.png EST Schedule in CPSW

**Fetch allow** is an 8-bit field, where each bit corresponds to the state of
each of the 8 gates (one per priority) in a given time slice.  The priority
being referred to in the context of EST maps to the CPSW *switch priority*
(not to be confused with other CPSW priority types: *packet priority* or
*header packet priority*).

**Fetch count** value is defined in terms of wireside clock cycles, so the link
speed needs to be taken into account when computing the value to be set in
hardware. This is taken care internally by the driver as the application can
simply pass the time slice duration in nanoseconds.

The shortest time slice allowed by CPSW is a fetch count of 16, which corresponds
to 128 nanoseconds for 1-Gbps link or 640 nanoseconds for 100-Mbps link.
The longest time slice allowed by CPSW is determined by the length of the fetch
count field (14-bits), which corresponds to 131.064 microseconds for 1-Gbps link
or 655.32 microsecondds for 100-Mbps link.

The **EST Fetch RAM** can be configured in *one buffer* (all 128 locations operate
as single buffer) or *two buffer operation* mode (two buffers of 64 locations
each).  Enet LLD configures the EST RAM in **two-buffer operation mode** in order
to use one of the buffers to hold the *operational list*, while the other buffer
can be programmed with the next *administrative list*.  It's worth noting that
only 16 of the 64 EST RAM locations are being currently used by the driver.
This limitation comes from the size of the \ref EnetTas_ControlList::gateCmdList
field in TAS IOCTL, which is \ref ENET_TAS_MAX_CMD_LISTS.

The **transmit queues size** is configurable in CPSW hardware via `CPSW_PN_MAX_BLKS`
and `CPSW_PN_TX_BLKS_PRI` registers.  `CPSW_PN_MAX_BLKS` can be used to set
how many 1-kB blocks of a total of 20-kB are partitioned for TX and RX.
`CPSW_PN_TX_BLKS_PRI` can be set used to specify how many of the 1-kB TX blocks
can be occupied per priority.  When all TX blocks allowed for a given priority
are used, any new frame of that priority will be dropped.

Note that the transmit queue sizes are not configurable via Enet LLD at the
moment.  The default setting is 16 blocks for TX and 4 for RX.
TX priority 7 can occupy all 16 blocks, priority 6 can occupy 15 blocks, ...,
priority 0 can occupy only 8 blocks.

The following call sequence diagrams shows the steps taken by the driver when
an administrative list is being programmed and EST is then being enabled.

## Programing Guidelines and Limitations {#enet_est_cpsw_guidelines}

### Administrative base time {#enet_est_cpsw_guidelines_admin_basetime}

As per EST/TAS specification, the administrative base time can be set to a time
ahead (future time) or behind current time (past time).  When set to a past
time, CPSW driver will start ESTF right away.  When set to a future time,
CPSW driver will handle it differently depending on the current EST state.

- If EST is in disabled (\ref ENET_TAS_DISABLE) or reset (\ref ENET_TAS_RESET),
  states, then driver will allow a non-zero administrative base time,
  potentially a future time.
- If EST is in enabled state (\ref ENET_TAS_ENABLE), then driver will reject
  any non-zero administrative base time.

Administrative base time at a future time is implemented in the driver using
ESTF *timestamp comparison* feature, where driver can program the desired
timestamp when ESTF will start generating its output.  The EST schedule is
programmed in EST RAM in advance, the active EST buffer is also set accordingly.
This sequence is simpler to program when EST is not enabled, which is the main
motivation for the special handling described in the previous points.

[Back To Top](\ref enet_tas_top)

### Gate control list {#enet_est_cpsw_guidelines_gate_control_list}

The gate control list passed to the CPSW EST driver can be one of the following
types:

- Gate operation with non-zero time interval and non-zero gate mask.  This
  is the *regular* gate operation for a time slice when at least one gate
  priority is enabled.  User must set the time interval within the following limits:
     - *Minimum time interval* is 16 wireside clocks, so the equivalent time in
       nanoseconds depends on link speed.  User can refer to the
       \ref CPSW_MACPORT_EST_TIME_MIN macro and pass the relevant link speed.
     - *Maximum time interval* is determined by the length of the fetch
       count field (14-bits). User can refer to the \ref CPSW_MACPORT_EST_TIME_MAX
       macro and pass the relevant link speed.

       | Link speed | Min time interval (nsecs) | Max time interval (nsecs) |
       | :--------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
       | 1 Gbps     | 128                       | 131,064                   |
       | 100 Mbps   | 640                       | 655,320                   |
       | 10 Mbps    | 6,400                     | 6,553,200                 |

- Gate operation with non-zero time interval and zero gate mask.  This is the gate
  operation used for guard band, intended to clear the wire for a packet in the
  next time interval.  Guard band is described in more detail in next subsection.

- Gate operation with zero time interval and non-zero gate mask.  This gate
  operation will cause CPSW to hold the corresponding fetch allow for the
  remaining duration of the cycle.
     - CPSW EST driver uses this gate operation type internally to handle
       *stretch* case (control list duration < cycle time).
     - Application can use this operation type, but it must not be followed by
       a non-zero interval which is treated as error.

- Gate operation with zero time and zero gate mask.  This is an invalid operation
  type.

[Back To Top](\ref enet_tas_top)

### Guard band {#enet_est_cpsw_guidelines_guard_band}

When computing the duration of the guard band, the user must follow the *zero allow*
guideline to compute the number of clocks needed to ensure wire is cleared from
previous packet transmission:

- 1-Gbps: `(maxPktLen + 4) + 292`.
- 10/100-Mbps: `((maxPktLen + 4) * 2) + 292`.

where `maxPktLen` is the maximum packet length (excluding FCS) in the previous
time interval.

For example, the guard band for 2020 bytes max frame size in the previous time
slot in a 100-Mbps link, the *zero allow* should be: `((2020 + 4) * 2) + 292 = 4340`.

Just like any other time interval, the duration of the guard band passed to
the driver has to be in nanoseconds but the zero allow values computed previuosly
is in wireside clocks, so it must be converted to nanoseconds:

- 1-Gbps: `((maxPktLen + 4) + 292) * 8`.
- 100-Mbps: `(((maxPktLen + 4) * 2) + 292) * 40`.
- 10-Mbps: `(((maxPktLen + 4) * 2) + 292) * 400`.

A helper macro (\ref CPSW_MACPORT_EST_GUARD_BAND) is provided to compute the
guard band duration.  User must pass the link speed (`1G`, `100M` or `10M`) and
the maximum packet length in the previuos time interval (excluding FCS).

For more details about the *zero allow* duration guideline, please refer to
the TRM section called *EST fetch values*, in the CPSW chapter.

### Link-down event {#enet_est_cpsw_guidelines_link_down}

As described in \ref enet_est_cpsw_driver section, the *fetch allow*
value programmed into EST RAM is in wireside clocks, so the link speed needs
to be taken into account when computing the allow value from a desired time
interval duration in microseconds.

When link is lost, the previous link speed is no longer valid or relevant,
hence CPSW driver will clear the previous operational list programmed in
EST RAM as part of its link lost event handling.

This also implies that application has to program again an administrative
control list via \ref ENET_TAS_IOCTL_SET_ADMIN_LIST command when link is
back up.  Enet LLD will not automatically restore the previous control list.

[Back To Top](\ref enet_tas_top)

### Limitations {#enet_est_cpsw_limitations}

The following EST features are not supported by the driver:
- Administrative cycle time different from current operational cycle time is not supported.
- Administrative cycle time extension is not supported.
- Configuration of Maximum SDU table is not supported.
- Administrative list needs to be configured again by application after link down
  events.

The following EST features have limited support in the driver:
- Administrative base time at a future time is only supported when EST is not enabled.
- Time slices longer than 131.064 microseconds (1-Gpbs) or 655.32 microseconds (100-Mbps)
  will be rejected by the driver.  It's up to the application to add two or more
  consecutive slots with same gate mask to accommodate for longer time slices.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting {#enet_est_cpsw_debugging}

### EST Timestamping {#enet_est_cpsw_timestamping}

EST packet timestamping can be used as an aid for debugging purposes to verify
if packets are being transmitted at the expect time based on the programmed EST
schedule.  CPSW supports four types of **timestamping modes**:

- Timestamp all packets on any priority.
- Timestamp all packets of given priority.
- Timestamp the first packet in each time interval (time slice).
- Timestamp the first packet of a given priority in the time interval.

CPSW driver provides the following private **EST timestamp related IOCTLs** to
*enable*, *disable* and *retrieve* the generated EST timestamp events:

- \ref CPSW_MACPORT_IOCTL_EST_ENABLE_TIMESTAMP. Enables EST packet timestamping
  according to the requested configuration (\ref CpswMacPort_EstTimestampCfg):
    - [CpswEstTsMode]. One of the four [CpswEstTsModeTypes] described earlier.
    - [CpswEstTsPri]. Only packets with this priority will be timestamped.
      Applicable to \ref CPSW_MACPORT_EST_TIMESTAMP_ONEPRI and
      \ref CPSW_MACPORT_EST_TIMESTAMP_FIRST_ONEPRI modes only.
    - [CpswEstTsDom]. EST timestamped events will have this domain id when
      retrieved from CPTS.

- \ref CPSW_MACPORT_IOCTL_EST_DISABLE_TIMESTAMP. Disables EST packet timestamping.

- \ref CPSW_CPTS_IOCTL_LOOKUP_EST_EVENT. Retrieves EST timestamps from CPTS
  driver using a match criteria (CpswCpts_EstEventMatchParams) of MAC port number
  and domain.  The domain should be the same one used during enable phase in
  \ref CPSW_MACPORT_IOCTL_EST_ENABLE_TIMESTAMP.

[CpswEstTsMode]: \ref CpswMacPort_EstTimestampCfg::mode "mode"
[CpswEstTsPri]:  \ref CpswMacPort_EstTimestampCfg::priority "priority"
[CpswEstTsDom]:  \ref CpswMacPort_EstTimestampCfg::domain "domain"
[CpswEstTsModeTypes]: \ref CpswMacPort_EstTimestampMode "timestamping modes"

Apart from the actual timestamp value in nanoseconds, the **EST timestamp events**
(\ref CpswCpts_EstEvent) also carry information about the priority (CPSW *switch
priority*), sequence number, ingress port (host port or another MAC port where
packet was initially received), egress port (the MAC port where EST packet was
transmitted) and the domain number.

Just like with any other CPTS event, CPSW driver services the CPTS interrupt
that is generated for each EST timestamp event, pops the event from the
CPTS FIFO and copies the event information into a software pool.  The timestamp
event will reside in this software pool until the application reads it through
\ref CPSW_CPTS_IOCTL_LOOKUP_EST_EVENT command.  This process will consume
additional CPU cycles so it's advised that this feature is not kept permanently
enabled.

The CPTS software pools (\ref ENET_CFG_CPSW_CPTS_EVENTS_POOL_SIZE) need to be sized
properly to accommodate for bursty traffic.  Driver will overwrite oldest events
in the pool as it handles new timestamp events.

### CCS Debug GEL Files {#enet_est_cpsw_gels}

CPSW debug GEL files can be loaded by loading the startup GEL file which can be
located at `<mcu_plus_sdk>/source/networking/enet/core/tools/debug_gels/cpsw_startup.gel`.

The following image shows the EST GEL files once they have been loaded into CCS.

  \image html Cpsw_Est_Gels.png CPSW EST debug GEL files

The available GEL functions are:

- `cpsw_est_show_global_config`. Shows the global EST enable configuration as well
  as few other relevant fields of `CPSW_CONTROL` register.
- `cpsw_est_show_config`. Shows the per MAC port relevant configuration:
     - EST enable.
     - EST control: buffer mode (one or two buffer), selected buffer, timestamp
       configuration.
     - EST status: active buffer.
     - MAC control: gigabit enable, full-duplex configuration.
- `cpsw_est_dump_ram`.  Dumps the non-zero EST RAM locations. Due to two-buffer mode
   used by the driver, expectation is to see non-zero locations at:
     - Indexes 0, 1, 2, ..., when buffer 1 is active.
     - Indexes 63, 64, 65, ...,  when buffer 2 is active.
- `cpsw_cpts_show_global_config`. Shows relevant CPTS global configuration which
  affects all ESTF instandes.
     - Global CPTS configuration in `CPTS_CONTROL` register, such as CPTS enable,
       mode (32 or 64-bit), among others.
     - CPTS timestamp add value in `CPTS_TS_ADD_VAL` register.  Useful to infer the
       CPTS reference clock frequency: `TS_ADD_VAL + 1` is the timestamp increment
       value per CPTS clock pulse.
- `cpsw_cpts_estf_show_config`. Shows the per MAC port ESTF configuration:
     - Admin base time is configured in `ESTF_COMP_HIGH` (32 msbits) and
       `ESTF_COMP_LOW` (32 lsbits) fields.
     - Cycle time is configured in `ESTF_LENGTH` field: `ESTF_LENGTH *
       (TS_ADD_VAL + 1)` is the cycle duration in nanoseconds.
- `cpsw_est_show_all_config`. Helper function that will run all previous GEL
  functions for a given MAC port.

Note that a pop-up window will appear when running GEL functions that are MAC port
dependent (i.e. EST RAM, ESTF).  Enter the value corresponding to the MAC port
of interest.

Enet LLD does not support CPSW EST for this SoC.
