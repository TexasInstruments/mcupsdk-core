# Need for sysconfig {#NeedForSysconfig}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Enet LLD enables syscfg based module configuration. This impacts application
using enet driver that are migrating from previous releases. The rationale for deep
sysconfig integration with enet driver is listed: 

- The Enet LLD driver contains core specific, board specific code. However in
  MCU+SDK all module libraries can only be SOC+ISA specific. There is no option
  to have core specific or board specific options when building a library.
  This required user of enet library to modify enet source code that is not
  built for the default core/board combo and recompile the enet library.
  This issue has been addressed by ensuring portions that are core or board 
  specific are part of syscfg template that  are compiled as part of application  
- Migrating open params of a module from C based to Sysconfig generated has 
  other advantages:
  + Range check for all values at config time instead of runtime parameter checks 
    + This reduces code size on target by eliminating error checks and minimizes erroneous configuration
  + Validation checks based on external module configuration like Clock config
  + Avoid uninitialized members in open params structure
    + Syscfg generated code will correctly initialize all members of openParams.
    + Allows easier migration to new versions and maintain backward compatibility without requiring application 
      code change.
      + Although the same is typically done in C code by means of Enet_InitCfg API, the syscfg approach reduces 
        target side code and ensure member initialization even if app fails to invoke Enet_InitCfg  API
  + Allows creation of external module instances needed by enet lld without requiring application integrator 
    to understand enet module external dependency. This simplifies system integration and reduces errors
    + UDMA instance is created as shared instance by Enet Module
    + I2C instances needed for board config can be created as shared instance by Enet Module
    + PRU instance interrupt configuration for ICSSG can be done by Enet Syscfg Module   
  + Allows sizing of data structures in enet driver based on application config
    + The number of tx dma channels, rx dma channels, number of enet phy instances, 
      enet resource manager configuration, number of packet buffers etc can be sized 
      correctly based on application usecase rather than sizing them for a worst case 
      if their allocation is determined by syscfg configuration
    + Enet LLD Driver library is built with close to zero r/w memory footprint
      + All data structures needed by EnetLLD drivers are sysconfig generated and sized correctly
        + For example : Enet_memInit  (Enet LLD function) invokes Enet_memGetCfg (Sysconfig generated code)
          which returns data structure with number of packets, rings, desc and associated memory that
          is generated based on application configuration and is right sized
  + Syscfg GUI allows presenting options in a scalable manner , showing only relevant options based on config 
    and enables descriptive error msgs for wrong configuration. 
    + Example of using  syscfg GUI to scalably present config options:
      + If Enable Packet Pool Allocation option is not selected none of the other packet pool configuration 
        options which are irrelevant are presented to the user
        ![Enable Packet Pool Allocation Disabled](PacketPoolConfig_EnablePacketPoolDisabled.png "Enable Packet Pool Allocation Disabled") {html: width=50%}
      + If Enable Packet Pool Allocation option is enabled the other packet pool configuration 
        options are presented to the user
        ![Enable Packet Pool Allocation Enabled](PacketPoolConfig_EnablePacketPoolEnabled.png "Enable Packet Pool Allocation Enabled") {html: width=50%}

# Enet DMA channel open changes {#EnetDmaChOpenChange}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Impact: The DMA channel open change impacts both ICSSG and CPSW peripherals on all SoCs
- Only applications directly invoke Enet driver packet transmit and receive APIs are impacted
  + LWIP based applications are not impacted 

The EnetDma_openRxCh() and EnetDma_openTxCh() DMA channel open was previously application callable APIs
Applications typically use EnetAppUtils wrapper APIs to open Tx and Rx DMA channels
- EnetAppUtils_openTxCh()
- EnetAppUtils_openRxCh()
- EnetAppUtils_openRxFlow()
- EnetAppUtils_openRxFlowForChIdx()

Supporting application invocable APIs for Tx and Rx DMA channel open required enet driver to support
worst case number for Tx and Rx channels and associated rings,descriptors irrespective of actual number
of channels used by application

Most application typically use 1 Tx and 1 Rx channel but the default enet library was built to support
upto 8 Tx and 8 Rx channels resulting in wastage of memory

To ensure the DMA channel and associated rings are sized to correct value based on application usecase, 
DMA channel configuration is now supported via syscfg

Sysconfig DMA channel config for AM263x/AWR294x/AM273x                                        | Sysconfig DMA channel config for AM243x_AM64x                                         |

All application configurable DMA channels open params that were configurable via 
APIs EnetAppUtils_openTxCh/ EnetAppUtils_openRxCh are now configurable via syscfg GUI
- One Tx and Rx channel are created by default
  + If application needs additional Tx and Rx channels it should instantiate additional channels via syscfg
    + Refer mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/enet_layer2_multi_channel/<soc-platform>/r5fss0-0_freertos/example.syscfg

The syscfg generated EnetApp_driverOpen function internally opens all configured DMA channels.
- Application can no longer opens DMA channels. 

Application gets handle to DMA channel by passing the DMA channel instance identifier used in example.syscfg
- enet_cpsw1.txDmaChannel[0].$name = "ENET_DMA_TX_CH0" /* Instance identified for Tx Dma channel 0 */
- enet_cpsw1.rxDmaChannel[0].$name = "ENET_DMA_RX_CH0" /* Instance identified for Rx Dma channel 0 */

To get DMA channel handle application invokes
- EnetApp_getTxDmaHandle(ENET_DMA_TX_CH0, &txInArgs, &txChInfo);
- EnetApp_getRxDmaHandle(ENET_DMA_RX_CH0, &rxInArgs, &rxChInfo);

# Runtime Control API (Enet_ioctl) change {#EnetIoctlChange}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Impact: The init sequence change impacts both ICSSG and CPSW peripherals on all SoCs

Rationale for change:
- Runtime control for Enet driver is supported via Enet_ioctl API call
- The Enet_ioctl API takes a CMD and associated params
  + Internally the Enet_ioctl was implemented as a switch..case statement .
- As all supported IOCTL cmds are implemented as a case statement, the linker 
  will link in code associated with all supported IOCTLs cmd (~300 cmd) irrespective 
  of whether the IOCTL cmd was invoked by application.
  + This results in large code size in the final application even though the application 
    may not be using all the IOCTL cmds.
- To resolve this issue, the Enet library has been modified to move to a model that ensures 
  only IOCTL cmds invoked by application are linked into the final executable

Old Enet_ioctl invocation method                                                              | New Enet_ioctl invocation method   |
:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  | :-------------                     |
status = Enet_ioctl(hEnet, coreId, IOCTL_CMD, &ioctlPrms);                                    | ENET_IOCTL(hEnet, coreId, IOCTL_CMD, &prms, ioctlReturnStatus);<br>ENET_IOCTL is a macro that first registers the handler function for the IOCTL cmd and then invokes the actual Enet_ioctl API.<br>This allows linker to link in only IOCTLs used by application into the executable

**Note**
Do not invoke Enet_ioctl API directly from application.
- It should result in compilation error due to missing prototype unless application is wrongly including some enet private header files.
  + If Enet_ioctl API  is invoked directly you will get a cmd failure 
- The IOCTL_CMD _has_ to be a ENET_IOCTL cmd enum and cannot be a variable. 
  + You will face linker error about undefined symbol if you use variable instead of enum for the IOCTL cmd param

# Packet Transmit/Receive API related changes {#PacketTxRxChange}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ----------

###Scatter Gather list related change ###### 
Impact: The Scatter Gather list change impacts CPSW peripherals on AM263x/AM273x/AWR294x
- Only applications directly invoke Enet driver packet EnetDma_submitTxPktQ() transmit APIs are impacted
  + LWIP based applications are not impacted 

Rationale for change:
- Support for transmit packets to be a scatter-gather list instead of a single contiguous packet has been added in SDK 8.2 release.
  + Enabling scatter gather for Tx packets allows zero-copy packet transmission in lwip stack improving transmit throughput

EnetDma_Pkt is the packet structure passed to EnetDma_submitTxPktQ (packet transmit) and EnetDma_retrieveRxPktQ (packet receive API)
  - This structure is modified to support scatter gather.
  - Application should invoke  EnetDma_initPktInfo API to initialize EnetDma_Pkt structure to default values
  - If application does not use tx scatter gather feature for packet transmission it should set
    + EnetDma_Pkt.bufPtrFilledLen = EnetDma_Pkt.txTotalPktLen = length of tx packet
  - If application uses the tx scatter gather feature please refer API documentation of EnetDma_Pkt and 
    refer mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/enet_tx_scatter_gather/txsg_test.c for example usage
  
###DisableCacheOps related change ###### 
Impact: The disableCacheOps change impacts CPSW peripherals on AM263x/AM273x/AWR294x
- Applications directly invoke Enet driver packet EnetDma_submitTxPktQ() transmit APIs are impacted
- UDP based LWIP applications are impacted 

Rationale for change:
- By default Enet driver will perform cache coherency operation on packet before submitting to enet DMA engine for packet transmission.
- As a performance optimization application may not want the cache coherency operation to be performed on the packet payload by driver 
  as the packet payload may not have been accessed by CPU (generated by HWA engine) or application may have handled the cache coherency 
  operation on the payload itself

If application is non-lwip based and application does not want to use this feature, it should invoke 
EnetDma_initPktInfo() API to initialize EnetDma_Pkt structure to default values where 
EnetDma_Pkt.disableCacheOps is set to FALSE for packets to be transmitted. It can then update 
rest of the fields in EnetDma_initPktInfo to required values.

If application is lwip based based and UDP packets are transmitted, application should perform cache coherency 
operation on payload before submitting the packet for transmission. This is because zero copy is enabled for UDP 
packet transmission and cache operation in driver are disabled for UDP payload portions. 
- Refer mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/lwip/enet_lwip_cpsw/udp_iperf.c: CacheP_wbInv function call for illustrative usage
  
###Checksum offload related change ###### 
Impact: The checksum offload change impacts CPSW peripheral based applications on AM263x
- Only applications directly invoke Enet driver packet EnetDma_submitTxPktQ() transmit APIs are impacted
  + LWIP based applications are not impacted 

Rationale for change:
- CPSW peripheral supports computation of UDP and TCP checksum in hardware. 
  This feature is called checksum offload and is enabled in SDK 8.4 release for AM263x
  This feature requires addition of a new EnetDma_Pkt.chkSumInfo field in EnetDma_Pkt

EnetDma_Pkt is the packet structure passed to EnetDma_submitTxPktQ (packet transmit) and EnetDma_retrieveRxPktQ (packet receive API)
As this structure is modified to support checksum offload by adding chkSumInfo , chkSumInfo should be initialized correctly by application

For application that directly invoke Enet driver packet transmit and receive APIs the application should set EnetDma_Pkt.chkSumInfo = 0
This will ensure the CPSW checksum offload feature is not exercised wrongly

# Custom Board Support {#CustomBoardSupport}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ----------
The MCU+SDK enet driver supports a set of boards for each SoC out of the box
- Refer MCU+SDK release notes for platforms/board supported for each SoC

The board specific portion of the enet code is auto generated in the file ti_board_config.c for supported boards

For porting enet based applications to custom board the following need to be done:
Enable "Custom Board" syscfg option ![CustomBoardSyscfg](CustomBoardSyscfg.png "Custom Board syscfg") {html: width=50%} 
- Enabling “Custom Board” will prevent auto generation of board specific code.
- A C file will have to be then written that is specific to the board.

### Board config C file
The board specific file should contain the following
- **const EnetPhy_DrvInfoTbl gEnetPhyDrvTbl**: This is a table of ENET PHY drivers supported on the board. 
  Refer Enet custom PHY integration guide for details on how to populate this table @ref enetphy_guide_top
- **EnetBoard_setupPorts()**: This function should setup any board level muxes and configure any SoC level 
  RGMII internal delay/ RMII configuration for the specific port. 
    + Refer API documentation for mcu_plus_sdk/source/networking/enet/utils/include/enet_board.h for details of function and arguments
- **EnetBoard_getPhyCfg()**: This function should return the ETHPHY specific configuration for a given port including any extended phy 
  configuration
    + Refer API documentation for mcu_plus_sdk/source/networking/enet/utils/include/enet_board.h for details of function and arguments
- **EnetBoard_getMacAddrList()**: This function should populate any board specific MAC addresses that are available on board eeprom.
  If the board does not have any board specific macAddresses this function should set argument `*pAvailMacEntries = 0`
- **EnetBoard_getId()**: This function should return the board id. This is not used anywhere outside this file so the board id returned 
  will depend on the implementation of EnetBoard_setupPorts()/EnetBoard_getPhyCfg()  for the custom board if it refers the boardId to 
  determine PHY config/setup ports.
- Refer mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/enet_layer2_multi_channel
    + enet_custom_board_config.c for example illustrating custom board integration

### Ethernet MAC address Management
Typically, one unique MAC address in burnt into efuse during device fabrication. Furthermore, additional MAC addresses are programmed in EEPROM on evaluation boards (EVM and launchpads) that are supported by TI.

There are two ways by which you can set the custom MAC address.

### 1. Using Syscfg GUI tool
An option is provided in Syscfg GUI tool to force custom MAC address instead of taking from EEPROM/EFUSE.

To use this option:
+Oopen syscfg GUI tool.
+ Go to "TI"->"ENET(CPSW)" (or "ENET(ICSS)")->"System integration config".
+ Change "MAC Address Assignment Method" to "Manual Entry" and fill the mac address in "MAC Address List" option.

![MACAddressManualEntry](enet_mac_addr_config_manual.png "MAC Address Manual Entry") 

+ Keeping  "MAC Address Assignment Method" to "Auto Assign", shall use the MAC address from EEPROM and EFUSE.

![MACAddressAuto Assign](enet_mac_addr_config_auto.png "MAC Address Auto Assign")
Please note that"Auto Assign" is not supported on AM273x and AWR294x due to EVM limitation.

### 2. Using Custom Board Option

On your custom board EEPROM may not be available or it is not used to keep MAC address, then please follow below steps to set MAC address-  
 1. Select custom board as per [previous section](\ref CustomBoardSupport)
 2. In your specific custom board specific .c file (eg.: enet_custom_board_config.c), refer to funtion `s()` implementation as below-
 
 \code
 void EnetBoard_getMacAddrList(uint8_t macAddr[][ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN],
                              uint32_t maxMacEntries,
                              uint32_t *pAvailMacEntries)
{
    int32_t status = ENET_SOK;
    uint32_t macAddrCnt;
    uint32_t i;
    uint8_t macAddrBuf[ENET_BOARD_NUM_MACADDR_MAX * ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN];
    uint8_t numMacMax  = 0;

    /* Fill the MAC Address */
    macAddrBuf[ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN*0] = {0xF4, 0x84, 0x4C, 0xFB, 0xC0, 0x5C};
    macAddrBuf[ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN*1] = {0xF4, 0x84, 0x4C, 0xFB, 0xC0, 0x5D};
    numMacMax = 2;
    macAddrCnt = EnetUtils_min(numMacMax, maxMacEntries);
    EnetAppUtils_assert(pAvailMacEntries != NULL);
    for (i = 0U; i < macAddrCnt; i++)
    {
        memcpy(macAddr[i], &macAddrBuf[i * ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN], ENET_MAC_ADDR_LEN);
    }

    *pAvailMacEntries = macAddrCnt;

    if (macAddrCnt == 0U)
    {
        EnetAppUtils_print("EnetBoard_getMacAddrList Failed - IDK not present\n");
        EnetAppUtils_assert(false);
    }
}
 \endcode

# External PHY management  {#ExternalPhyManagement}
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ----------
External PHY management allows application plugging in its own PHY state machine and manage PHY drivers outside of Enet LLD
- PHY control and PHY statemachine handling is disabled in Ethernet driver
- MDIO is still owned by Ethernet Driver and MDIO IOCTLs should be used to access the PHYs
  + mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/lwip/enet_lwip_cpsw/extPhyMgmt/enetextphy_phymdio_dflt.c
- External PHY management is enabled via syscfg option ![ExternalPhyManagementSyscfg](ExternalPHYManagementSyscfg.png "External PHY management syscfg") {html: width=50%}
- Application should register for MDIO link event interrupt if MDIO manual mode is not enabled
  + Application should create a periodic polling task to check link state if MDIO manual mode is enabled
    + This is because MDIO link event interrupt is not supported in MDIO manual mode (bitbanging mode)
- Application should invoke below IOCTLs to inform Enet driver of link up/down events
  + ENET_PER_IOCTL_HANDLE_EXTPHY_LINKUP_EVENT
  + ENET_PER_IOCTL_HANDLE_EXTPHY_LINKDOWN_EVENT
- Refer example application for extphy demonstration
  + mcu_plus_sdk/examples/networking/lwip/enet_lwip_cpsw

Note: The external PHY sample example does not implement a real state m/c. Intention is to show Enet driver 
interaction with externally managed PHY and not implement a full featured external PHY

Syscfg integration allows the enet driver rwdata memory footprint to be  sized based on application configuration
Key params that are useful for tuning the rw data memory are
- Maximum number of packets for Tx and Rx Dma channel. This is configurable via syscfg
- For non-lwip application , the enet library  packet pool allocation can be enabled

This release does not support similar syscfg based configuration of packet pools for lwip based examples. This will be addressed in the future releases.
In the current release for lwip based application to tune memory the following option exists
- Set maximum number of packets for Tx and Rx Dma channel. This is configurable via syscfg 
- Update mcu_plus_sdk/source/networking/lwip/lwip-config/`<soc>`/lwippools.h as per application requirement
- Update mcu_plus_sdk/source/networking/lwip/lwip-config/`<soc>`/lwipopts.h
  + PBUF_POOL_SIZE : This determines number of Rx packets. 
    + The Rx Dma channel max number of packets should be updated if this value is modified
- **Changes to lwipopts.h and lwippools require recompilation of library**

Syscfg option                 | Description                                                                                                  |
:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
Dual-Mac Mode Port            |Select the MAC_PORT to be used for the DUAL MAC ICSSG instance selected.<br>Applicable only in Dual mac mode. |
QoS Level                     |Number of quality of service priority levels that need to be supported in ICSSG                               |
Premption Enable              |Enable ICSSG preemption TSN  feature                                                                          |
Gigabit support               |Enable gigabit link support. Enabling gigabit support will result in increased memory requirements for the ICSS firmware | 
Mcm Enable                    |Enable multi client/multi core support<br> This needs to be enabled only incase there are independent non-coperative clients of the ethernet driver. <br> MCM module will manage the Ethernet driver handle reference counting, PHY state machine scheduling etc |
AppLinkUpPortMask Config      |Syscfg generates function to determine if link is up. This option determines if all ports should be checked for link up or if it is sufficient for any port to have link up |
