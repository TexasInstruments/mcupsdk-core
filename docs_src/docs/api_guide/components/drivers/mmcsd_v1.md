[TOC]

Multi-Media Card Secure Digital (MMCSD) peripheral is a driver which provides an interface with storage devices which follows MMC/SD/SDIO protocol. The driver supports single bit, four bit data lines to communicate with the connected media. The MMCSD controller provides accessibility to external MMC/SD/SDIO devices using a programmed IO method. There is only one MMCSD module inside the SOC - MMCSD0.

## Features Supported

- 64-bit data, address width System Bus Interface
- SD command/response sets as defined in the SD Physical Layer specification v2.00
- Operating voltage range VCC = 3.3 V
- High-speed MMCSD protocol, Clock frequency : 0-200MHz

## SysConfig Features
