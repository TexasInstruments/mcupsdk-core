## GPMC Overview

The GPMC basic programming model offers maximum flexibility to support various access protocols for each of
the four configurable chip-selects. Use optimal chip-select settings, based on the characteristics of the external
device:
- Different protocols can be selected to support generic asynchronous or synchronous random-access devices
(NOR flash, SRAM) or to support specific NAND devices.
- The address and data bus can be multiplexed on the same external bus.
- Read and write access can be independently defined as asynchronous or synchronous.
- System requests (byte, 16-bit word, burst) are performed through single or multiple accesses. External
access profiles (single, multiple with optimized burst length, native- or emulated-wrap) are based on external
device characteristics (supported protocol, bus width, data buffer size, native-wrap support).
- System burst read or write requests are synchronous-burst (multiple-read or multiple-write). When neither
burst nor page mode is supported by external memory or ASIC devices, system burst read or write requests
are translated to successive single synchronous or asynchronous accesses (single reads or single writes).
8-bit wide devices are supported only in single synchronous or single asynchronous read or write mode.
- To simulate a programmable internal-wait-state, an external WAIT pin can be monitored to dynamically
control external access at the beginning (initial access time) of and during a burst access.
Each control signal is controlled independently for each chip-select. The internal functional clock of the GPMC
(GPMC_FCLK) is used as a time reference to specify the following:
    1. Read- and write-access duration
    2. Most GPMC external interface control-signal assertion and deassertion times
    3. Data-capture time during read access
    4. External wait-pin monitoring time
    5. Duration of idle time between accesses, when required

Below figure shows the GPMC functional block diagram. The GPMC consists of six blocks:
- Interconnect port interface
- Address decoder, GPMC configuration, and chip-select configuration register file
- Access engine
- Prefetch and write-posting engine
- Error correction code engine (ECC)
- External device/memory port interface

The GPMC can access various external devices. The flexible programming model allows a wide range of
attached device types and access schemes.
Based on the programmed configuration bit fields stored in the GPMC registers, the GPMC can generate the
timing of all control signals depending on the attached device and access type.
Given the chip-select decoding and its associated configuration registers, the GPMC selects the appropriate
control signal timing for the device type

## ECC Calculator
- The GPMC includes an error code correction (ECC) calculator circuitry that enables ECC calculation on the fly
during data read or data program (that is, write) operations. The page size supported by the ECC calculator in
one calculation/context is 512 bytes.
- The user can choose from two different algorithms with different error correction capabilities through the
GPMC_ECC_CONFIG[16] ECCALGORITHM bit:
    1. Hamming code for 1-bit error code correction on 8- or 16-bit NAND flash organized with page size greater
    than 512 bytes
    2. Bose-Chaudhurl-Hocquenghem (BCH) code for 4- to 16-bit error correction
The GPMC does not handle the error code correction directly. During writes, the GPMC computes parity bits.
During reads, the GPMC provides enough information for the processor to correct errors without reading the
data buffer all over again.
- The Hamming code ECC is based on a 2-dimensional (2D) (row and column) bit parity accumulation. This
parity accumulation is accomplished on the programmed number of bytes or 16-bit words read from the memory
device, or is written to the memory device in stream mode.
- Because the ECC engine includes only one accumulation context, it can be allocated to only one chip-select
at a time through the GPMC_ECC_CONFIG[3-1] ECCCS bit field. Even if two chip-selects use different ECC
algorithms, one the Hamming code and the other a BCH code, they must define separate ECC contexts because
some of the ECC registers are common to all types of algorithms.
