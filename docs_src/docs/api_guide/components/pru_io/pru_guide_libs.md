## Assembly Library files

Many header files are packaged in SDK which defines `macros` which can be directly used when coding in assembly, path = `<sdk/source/pru_io/firmware/>` with extension `.inc`
Documentation for those can be found here: \htmllink{../pru_macros_docs/index.html, PRU Source Macros Documentation}

Refer to [pru-software-support-package/include](https://git.ti.com/cgit/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package/tree/include/am64x) for available library files available for development in C. And follow [pru-software-support-package/labs](https://git.ti.com/cgit/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package/tree/labs) to get started with using these libraries.
