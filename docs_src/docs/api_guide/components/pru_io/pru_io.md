## Introduction

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
The Sitara Devices contain PRU Cores which are capable of executing instructions in a completely deterministic manner. The various clock speed options available are 200MHz, 225MHz, 250MHz, 300MHz, 333MHz giving us a resolution of upto 3ns. This allows us to use PRU Cores for realtime I/O control applications. The modules present in this section provides support for quicker development of software for such use-cases.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX
The Sitara Devices contain PRU Cores which are capable of executing instructions in a completely deterministic manner. The clock speed options available is 200MHz giving us a resolution of upto 5ns. This allows us to use PRU Cores for realtime I/O control applications. The modules present in this section provides support for quicker development of software for such use-cases.
