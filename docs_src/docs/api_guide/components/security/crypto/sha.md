# SHA {#DRIVERS_DTHE_SHA_PAGE}

### Access Protection Scheme
AES and SHA IP in DTHE support two contexts, namely Public and Secure. 

### SHA
- The Hash/HMAC engine performs the SHA-1, SHA-2, and MD5 hash computation. 
When loaded with a data block, and optionally an intermediate digest, it 
independently performs the hash computation (64 or 80 rounds, depending on the 
algorithm) on that data block.

- The engine can also start from the specified initial digest values instead of
 a loaded intermediate. Furthermore, it can perform the IPAD and OPAD XORs for 
MAC operations. The hash core does not perform any hash padding; this is 
performed in the host interface block, where the data input registers are 
located. A loaded data block must always be a full 64 bytes (512 bits) long.
