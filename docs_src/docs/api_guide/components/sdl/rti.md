# RTI {#SDL_RTI_PAGE}

[TOC]
The Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) generates reset after a programmable period, if not serviced within that period. This time-out boundary is configurable, and the windowed feature allows the start time boundary to be configurable. The WWDT can generate an Interrupt, if not serviced within window (Open Window) defined by start time and time-out boundary. Also the WWDT can generate an Interrupt if serviced outside Open Window (within Closed Window). Generation of Interrupt depends on the WWDT Reaction configuration. SDL supports configuration of the watchdog timers. It also supports notification of the error via ESM interrupt. Additionally, APIs for checking the status of the watchdog timer is provided.

## Features Supported
The RTI modules include the following main features:
* Ability to to initialize the RTI -DWWD module.
* Ability to configure RTI -DWWD module.
* Ability to service an RTI instance.
* Ability to read Status of the configuration.
* Ability to read back static register.

\cond SOC_AM263X
There are Four RTI Timer instances, implemented by the Real-time Interrupt function of the RTI/WWDT module.
Four Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT) instances, implemented by the Digital Windowed Watchdog
(DWWD) function of the RTI/WWDT module

The WWDT instances are intended to function as a digital windowed watchdog for the CPU core that they are
associated with:
* WWDT0 is dedicated to the first R5F CPU core (R5FSS0_CORE0)
* WWDT1 is dedicated to the second R5F CPU core (R5FSS0_CORE1)
* WWDT2 is dedicated to the third R5F CPU core (R5FSS1_CORE0)
* WWDT3 is dedicated to the fourth R5F CPU core (R5FSS1_CORE1)
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X
There are Five Real Time Interrupts (RTI) modules, three in MSS and two in DSS.
Two Watchdog modules, one in DSS and one in MSS (Same RTI IP but in Watchdog configuration)

The WWDT instances are intended to function as a digital windowed watchdog for the CPU core that they are
associated with:

* MSS_WDT is dedicated to the first R5F CPU core (R5FSS0_CORE0)
* DSS WDT is dedicated to C66 DSP core (C66SS0)
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
There are 7 RTI Modules in the device – 1 in the MCU domain and 6 in the Main domain

Instances in MCU domain:

1)	MCU_RTI0 is dedicated to the MCU cluster (MCU_M4FSS0) in lockstep and when unlocked serves as a Windowed Watchdog for the first M4F CPU core in the MCU domain (MCU_M4FSS0_CORE0).

Instances in Main domain:

1)	RTI0 is dedicated to the first A53 CPU core in the A53 cluster (A53SS0_CORE0)
2)	RTI1 is dedicated to the second A53 CPU core in the A53 cluster (A53SS0_CORE1)
3)	RTI8 is dedicated to the first R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS0_CORE0)
4)	RTI9 is dedicated to the second R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS0_CORE1)
5)	RTI10 is dedicated to the third R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS1_CORE0)
6)	RTI11 is dedicated to the fourth R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS1_CORE1)
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM243X
There are 5 RTI Modules in the device – 1 in the MCU domain and 4 in the Main domain

Instances in MCU domain:

1)	MCU_RTI0 is dedicated to the MCU cluster (MCU_M4FSS0) in lockstep and when unlocked serves as a Windowed Watchdog for the first M4F CPU core in the MCU domain (MCU_M4FSS0_CORE0).

Instances in Main domain:

1)	RTI8 is dedicated to the first R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS0_CORE0)
2)	RTI9 is dedicated to the second R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS0_CORE1)
3)	RTI10 is dedicated to the third R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS1_CORE0)
4)	RTI11 is dedicated to the fourth R5F CPU core in the Main domain (R5FSS1_CORE1)
\endcond

All WWDT instances that are provisioned for a particular CPU core should not be used by any other CPU cores.
