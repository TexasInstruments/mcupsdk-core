## TI Uniflash {#TOOLS_TI_UNIFLASH_TOOL}

\note Sitara MCU devices now supports TI Uniflash Tool for loading/flashing images into the target. Please refer \ref TI_UNIFLASH_TOOL for more details.

\cond SOC_AM243X
### JTAG Session
\attention It is recommended to do \ref EVM_SOC_INIT_NOBOOT_MODE and disconnect the R5 Core from CCS before flashing the image from UNIFLASH.

1.  Set the board in \ref BOOTMODE_NOBOOT mode and do a power cycle prior to loading.

2.  Choose a Program to Flash:
    - Click the "Browse" button to select the program you want to flash.
    - The default start address is automatically filled. UniFlash requires the full address since flash offsets are not supported.
    \imageStyle{load_jtag.png,width:70%}
    \image html load_jtag.png "Load Binary Image (Address may change from device to device)"
    - Do not modify the address field for XIP file type. The field is used by the flash loader to recognize XIP files.
3.  Flash Address Table:
    - The table below shows the flash addresses accepted by the ROM/SBL to load programs onto the target:
        | Program     | Start Address |
        |-------------|---------------|
        | SBL         | 0x60000000    |
        | Application | 0x60080000    |
    - Edit the application offset field only, if your sbl is configured with custom application offset
4.  Initiating Programming:
    - After clicking "Load Image," UniFlash starts the programming process, and the console displays a log of each operation. **[SUCCESS] Program Load completed successfully** will get printed in the console, if the program loads into the target successfully.

### Flash tool error messages and solutions {#TOOLS_FLASH_ERROR_MESSAGES}

If the flashing fails, the error message will give a hint as to why it failed.
Some common error messages, reasons and potential solutions are listed below.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Error
    <th>Possible Reason
    <th>Solution
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> Serial port not found or not accessible
    <td> Wrong UART port passed as argument or the UART port is open in some other terminal application.
    <td> Check the UART port, UART ports are named as `COM1`, `COM2`, and so on in Windows and as `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyUSB1`, and so on in Linux.
         Also make sure to close all open UART terminals and try again.
</tr>

### GUI for UART Uniflash (Experimental) {#TOOLS_UART_UNIFLASH_GUI}

UART Uniflash GUI is a GUI wrapper around the UART Uniflash tool already present (`uart_uniflash.py`). This is a strictly experimental feature with minimal testing from TI side. Can be used if GUI is more comfortable. Since most of the CLI tool is used underneath, it is the same functionality wise

#### Pre-Requisites for UART Uniflash GUI

This GUI is built on top of the python based UART Uniflash CLI tool already mentioned, and specifically based on the PyQt5 binding of the QT5 framework. So it is expected that python3 and other dependencies (xmodem, pyserial etc) are already installed. In addition to this, one also needs to install the PyQt5 python library for the GUI to work.

- In windows, you can install PyQt5 by doing below:

  `python -m pip install pyqt5`

- In Ubuntu (or other Debian based distros) you can install PyQt5 by doing below:

  `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`

### Using the UART Uniflash GUI

The UART Uniflash GUI can be used to flash files arbitrarily into the device flash

\imageStyle{uniflash_gui_manual_config_sport.png,width:40%}
\image html uniflash_gui_manual_config_sport.png "UART Uniflash GUI : Serial Port Selection"

At the top there is a drop down to select the UART COM port which will be used for flashing. Please connect the target to the EVM before running the GUI so that the serial port we are interested will show up here.

- For choosing what to flash and how to flash there are two high level choices in UART Uniflash GUI:
  - Manual Config
  - From File

    \imageStyle{uniflash_gui_manual_config.png, width:50%}
    \imageStyle{uniflash_gui_file_config.png, width:50%}

<table style="border: 0 px">
    <tr>
        <td> \image html uniflash_gui_manual_config.png "UART Uniflash GUI : Manual Config based flashing" </td>
        <td> \image html uniflash_gui_file_config.png "UART Uniflash GUI : Config file based flashing" </td>
    </tr>
</table>

- **Manual Config** : Manual configuration of the files to be flashed. There will be drop down file browse options to select the various files you will need to flash/send to the target. It provides options / slots to select below:

  - **Flash writer binary** : This is the sbl_uart_uniflash binary. This needs to be send first for the ROM to receive and boot. Once this boots up you can send any number of files arbitrarily for flashing.

  - **Bootloader binary** : It is assumed that the eventual goal of the flashing process is to boot your application from the flash device. For this a bootloader capable of reading an image from flash device needs to be flashed at offset 0 (generally) of the flash. This would be the `sbl_ospi` or `sbl_qspi`. Although this is no different than flashing any other file to a particular offset, we have decided to keep it a separate option for better clarity. Although the offset is almost always 0, we have provided an offset edit box as well if there is any change whatsoever.
\if SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
  - **Appimage binary** : You can select the application image to be flashed from this slot. SDK convention is to flash at a 512 KB offset (0x81000). This can be changed, but keep in mind that the bootloader booting this application should be aware of this offset as well. It is a configurable option in the Sysconfig of the bootloader.
\else

\endif 
\cond SOC_AM243X || SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
  - **Appimage XIP binary** : You can select the XIP component to your application from this slot. These files will be of the format (`*.appimage_xip`). These files already contain details as to where these need to be flashed, so no need to provide any offset in this case.
\endcond
  - **Custom data** : This slot can be used to flash any custom data file at an arbitrary offset. Don't forget to provide the offset

  - **Flash PHY tuning data** : In certain NOR SPI drivers, for tuning the PHY, known data needs to be present in the flash. This is a fixed size (usually 128 bytes) array written to the last block of the flash. This check box needs to be ticked if you're flashing for the first time to the target so that this known data can be written to the flash.

  \imageStyle{uniflash_gui_manual_config_flash_phy_tuning.png,width:40%}
  \image html uniflash_gui_manual_config_flash_phy_tuning.png "UART Uniflash GUI : Saving the manual configuration"

  - There is an option to save the settings you selected manually as a config file using the **Save CFG** button towards the bottom right of the Manual Config group.

\imageStyle{uniflash_gui_manual_config_save_cfg.png,width:40%}
\image html uniflash_gui_manual_config_save_cfg.png "UART Uniflash GUI : Saving the manual configuration"

- **From File** : Flash using a configuration file (`*.cfg` extension) specifying what needs to be flashed. This is a convenient option if the files to be flashed are pretty much the same for every try. In fact even in the manual config case, a cfg file is created internally and used for flashing. This `cfg` follows the same format used by the CLI script.

After selecting the config options and files, just press the **FLASH** button to start the flashing. A progress bar will show the flashing progress.

There is also a log area which will show detailed logs in addition to the pop up messages.

### Important Notes and Common Pitfalls in UART Uniflash GUI

- Make sure that the target device is powered ON and is in UART boot mode before attempting to flash
- Make sure that the correct COM port is selected from the drop down. If the wrong port is selected, the flasher might take time to exit out as it will wait for the device to send the XMODEM control character.
- If the GUI seems to hang, re-check the selected COM port and make sure the EVM is **powered ON** and in **UART boot mode**
- The GUI is based on the `uart_uniflash.py` CLI script, and reuses a lot of objects and functions, so core functionality is the same among both.
- In manual config case, if a drop down is non blank it is assumed that the file provided there needs to be flashed. So it will be picked up and used when `FLASH` button is clicked. If this is not required, make sure to delete it and keep it blank, the drop down is editable. This is true for the config file drop down as well, but the mishap is more probable in manual config case.

## USB DFU Uniflash{#TOOLS_FLASH_DFU_UNIFLASH}

- **usb_dfu_uniflash.py** is a tool which is used for flashing the images onto the flash memory using USB DFU protocol.
It uses \ref INSTALL_DFU_UTIL tool to underneath to send binaries via USB.
- This tool is used in conjuction with \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_SBL_DFU_UNIFLASH which is a flash-writer application.

- refer \ref EXAMPLES_USB_DFU for more information on DFU.

### USB DFU bootflow using dfu based flash-writer.

- Following diagram explains boot flow using USB DFU and SBL OSPI.
- Its a three step process.
	1. Put the device into DFU BOOT mode refer \ref BOOTMODE_DFU. After this ROM Bootoader will accept a valid SBL image
	via USB and boot it. In this case we will boot \ref EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_SBL_DFU_UNIFLASH which is a flash-writer binary.
	2. Once flash-writer is booted a new USB DFU capable device will be enumerated. After this using **usb_dfu_uniflash.py** tool
	we will send **SBL_OSPI** or **SBL_QSPI** along with multicore appimage. Flash-writer SBL will flash the received files onto
	flash memory.
	3. Change the boot mode to \ref BOOTMODE_OSPI and power cycle the board. First **SBL_OSPI** or **SBL_QSPI** will be booted from flash
	and later it is responsible to boot the multicore appimages.

\cond SOC_AM261X
\code
  cd ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot
  python usb_dfu_uniflash.py --cfg={path to your edited config file} --use-sdk-utility
\endcode

  - This **--use-sdk-utility** option selects the custom DFU util from the SDK to perform DFU operations.
\endcond

  \imageStyle{dfu_flash_bootflow.png,width:40%}
  \image html dfu_flash_bootflow.png


### Tool requirements on host PC

- The tool is implemented using python and needs python version 3.x
- Refer to the page, \ref INSTALL_PYTHON3 , to install python and the required python packages on your PC.
- It uses **dfu-util** tool to execute dfu commands from the host PC.
- Refer to the page \ref INSTALL_DFU_UTIL , to install **dfu-util** tool.

### Basic steps to flash files {#BASIC_STEPS_TO_FLASH_FILES_DFU}

 - The flashing steps are same as refer \ref BASIC_STEPS_TO_FLASH_FILES only difference is instead of using ~~uart_uniflash.py~~ use **usb_dfu_uniflash.py**.


#### Flashing the files

- Set EVM in \ref BOOTMODE_DFU and power on the EVM

- Run below python command on the Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`) or Linux bash shell to flash the files.

        cd ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot
        python usb_dfu_uniflash.py --cfg={path to your edited config file}

- At each step in the flashing your will see success or error messages, including progress as the file is being transferred.

\cond SOC_AM243X || SOC_AM64X

- If flashing is successful, power OFF the EVM, set the EVM to \ref BOOTMODE_OSPI and power ON the EVM to run the flashed application.
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM263X 
- If flashing is successful, power OFF the EVM, set the EVM to \ref BOOTMODE_QSPI and power ON the EVM to run the flashed application.
\endcond
\cond SOC_AM263PX || SOC_AM261X
- If flashing is successful, power OFF the EVM, set the EVM to \ref BOOTMODE_OSPI and power ON the EVM to run the flashed application.
\endcond

- If flashing is not successful, then DFU device i.e EVM must have send error status in **GET_STATUS** phase of **SETUP** transfer. This error condition
will be detected by **dfu-util** tool and will be displayed on console.

### Basic steps to flash files over ethernet {#BASIC_STEPS_TO_FLASH_FILES_OVER_ENET}

#### Getting ready to flash

- Make sure the QSPI Ethernet bootloader (`sbl_qspi_enet`) has been flashed using the steps provided in \ref BASIC_STEPS_TO_FLASH_FILES.
- Make sure the user application (`*.appimage`) you want to flash over ethernet is built for the EVM.

#### Flash configuration file

- Create a flash configuration file, using the default flash configuration file present

        ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot/sbl_prebuilt/{board}/default_sbl_qspi.cfg

- In this config file, modify the paths to the application to be flashed only.

   Remove or comment out the flash-writer path

        --flash-writer={path to flash application .tiimage}

   Remove or comment out the bootloader path

        --file={path to QSPI bootloader .tiimage} --operation=flash --flash-offset=0x0

   Edit below line to point to the user application (`.appimage`) file

        --file={path to your application .appimage file} --operation=flash --flash-offset=0xA0000

#### Flashing the files over ethernet

- Run below python command on the Windows command prompt (`cmd.exe`) or Linux bash shell to flash the files.

        cd ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/boot
        python enet_uniflash.py --cfg={path to your edited config file}

- When the python script starts, it will display the message "Starting Linkup ...".

  Based on the MACRO ENETSBL_TRANSFER_START_MODE set in sbl_enet.h of the sbl_qspi_enet bootloader, do either of the below when the above message is observed,
    - If in ENETSBL_TIMER_MODE, Press the reset button SW1 on the EVM.
    - If in ENETSBL_BUTTON_MODE, Press the reset button SW1 while holding down the user switch SW2.

- After flashing is successful, the flashed application code will be automatically run after the SBL completes. See \ref SBL_QSPI_ENET_OUTPUT_SAMPLE for a sample of the python script output after a successful flash.

#### Flash tool options

- Type below to see all the possible options with the flashing tool and also see the default .cfg file for syntax and options possible in the config file
