# PRU-ICSS Firmware for MDIO Manual Mode {#INDUSTRIAL_COMMS_MDIO_MANUALMODE_FW_USAGE}

## Hardware Issue
If your silicon is affected with errata <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz457e/sprz457e.pdf" target="_blank">i2329â€” MDIO interface corruption</a>, then TI suggests to use MDIO Manual mode as software workaround mentioned below.

## Working of PRU-ICSS Firmware for MDIO Manual Mode

- Firmware Code Flow
    1. Configures the MDIO Control Register to enable the MDIO state machine once for some period (less than 1us) and then disables it.
    2. Configures the MDIO hardware in 'MDIO_MODE_MANUAL' and keeps the MDIO internal state machine disabled.
    3. Uses the new defined/emulated register space to emulate the actual MDIO register space.
    4. Configures the MDIO hardware by copying over the MDIO register configuration values from emulated register space to the actual MDIO addresses.
    5. Then the firmware runs in a loop, and checks if there are any pending PHY access requests by checking the `GO` bit of the user-access registers. If there is any pending PHY access request, it performs the operation and clears the `GO` bit of the user-access register.
    7. The firmware manually drives the MDIO_DATA and MDIO_CLK pins using MANUAL_IF_REG registers of MDIO to execute the PHY operations (in clause22 mode only). The MDIO_CLK frequency is fixed around 2.5MHz.
    8. It updates the PHY Alive Status register.
    9. If set in Link Status Polling Mode, it updates the PHY Link Status by manually polling the PHY register. Also, if interrupt is enabled it generates PHY Link Change interrupt on same interrupt
- Other cores can use the user-access registers to perform PHY accesses. Both MDIO_USER_ACCESS_REG_0 and MDIO_USER_ACCESS_REG_1 registers are emulated by firmware.

## SDK8.5 VS SDK8.6 CHANGES

The firmware now adds support for:
  - Emulation of PHY Alive Register by reading the PHY BMSR Register.
  - Link polling mode in which firmware periodically checks for links status changes and updates the MDIO Link Register. If enabled, it will also generate interrupt on link status change. This allows link status update without using RXLINK pins.
  - Ability to configure same MDIO Clk frequency for different PRU Clk frequencies.

## Example Usage
This section describes how to use the manual-mode firmware to make PHY register accesses.

### Sysconfig

Enable the manual mode option from SysConfig from the protocol specific module. Enabling this updates the MDIO base address which will be used by the ETHPHY driver.

### Load PRU firmware

Order to follow for loading MDIO Manual MDIO firmware:
- Make sure any MDIO access is made only after the firmware has been loaded.
- Clear the register space which will be used by firmware for MDIO register space emulation.
- Load the PRU firmware and set the R10 register for fw configuration as explained above and R12 register to the emulated MDIO base register offset.
- Enable/run the PRU core and then we can create PHY access requests using MDIO User Access Register.

- The emulated register space start address has to be passed to the firmware by setting the R12 CPU register to the desired location for emulating the MDIO register space.
    - For example, if we set R12 to 0x00010000 (ICSSG shared memory offset) for ICSSG1 instance, the MDIO registers will start from 0x30090000 and so the user access registers' offsets will be (0x30090000+0x80) for USER_ACCESS_0_REG and (0x30090000+0x88) for USER_ACCESS_1_REG.
- For MDIO Clk freq to remain constant (~2.5MHz) we need to inform PRU Clk frequency using R10 CPU register as explained below. (default configuration will be MLINK Based link detection and MDIO Clk acc. to 200MHz PRU Clock):

|           |    1 : enabled                                                 |

\note Each protocol will have different base register offset configured depending on the availability of free memory region. Emulated MDIO register space start address will be visible from the SysConfig interface as well.

Check the function `tiesc_mdioManualModeSetup()` in `tiescsoc.c` at location `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave_beckhoff_ssc_demo/am64x-evm/tiescsoc.c` for understanding how to load and run the PRU firmware.

The PRU firmware can be built using the example present at `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples/pru_io/mdio_fw`.

By default the MDIO manual mode firmware is loaded on TX_PRU core, but we can load the same firmware on other unused RTU_PRU or TX_PRU cores if needed.

### Using User Access Registers
Creating PHY access requests from the R5F core remains same as all the configuration settings (for changing the MDIO base address) are modified by SysConfig. There is no change in the MDIO driver APIs, only the base address has to change for the API calls.

## Impact
- One PRU is now reserved for emulating MDIO Manual Mode functionality.
- For MDIO API Usage, the base address is now changed. \ref MDIO_initClock API call is not needed.
- Following Registers are not available when using MDIO manual mode firmware (from the emulated register space):
    -   MDIO_VERSION_REG (MDIO Version Register)
    -   MDIO_CONTROL_REG (MDIO Control Register)
    -   MDIO_LINK_INT_RAW_REG (MDIO Link Interrupt Raw Register)
    -   MDIO_LINK_INT_MASKED_REG (MDIO Link Interrupt Masked Register)
    -   MDIO_LINK_INT_MASK_SET_REG (MDIO Link Interrupt Mask Set Register)
    -   MDIO_LINK_INT_MASK_CLEAR_REG (MDIO Link Interrupt Mask Clear Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_INT_RAW_REG (MDIO User Interrupt Raw Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_INT_MASKED_REG (MDIO User Interrupt Masked Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_INT_MASK_SET_REG (MDIO User Interrupt Mask Set Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_INT_MASK_CLEAR_REG (MDIO User Interrupt Mask Clear Register)
    -   MDIO_MANUAL_IF_REG (MDIO Manual Interface Register)
    -   MDIO_POLL_REG (MDIO Poll Inter Register)
    -   MDIO_POLL_EN_REG (MDIO Poll Enable Register)
    -   MDIO_CLAUS45_REG (Clause 45 Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_ADDR0_REG (MDIO User Address 0 Register)
    -   MDIO_USER_ADDR1_REG (MDIO User Address 1 Register)

- Only following registers are available when using MDIO manual mode firmware (from the emulated register space):
    - MDIO_ALIVE_REG (MDIO Alive Register)
    - MDIO_LINK_REG (MDIO Link Register)
    - MDIO_USER_ACCESS_REG_0 (MDIO User Access 0 Register)
    - MDIO_USER_PHY_SEL_REG_0 (MDIO User PHY Select 0 Register)
    - MDIO_USER_ACCESS_REG_1 (MDIO User Access 1 Register)
    - MDIO_USER_PHY_SEL_REG_1 (MDIO User PHY Select 1 Register)


## Constraints and Limitations
- In MLINK Mode, MLINK pin (same as RX_LINK pins) is necessary for MDIO_LINK_REG updates.
    We need MLINK feature of MDIO to do automatic polling of link status via the MIIx_RXLINK input pin to PRU-ICSS which must be connected to a status output from the external PHY which does not toggle while the link is active.

    \cond SOC_AM243X

    \note

    In the E1/E2 revision of @VAR_LP_BOARD_NAME_LOWER board, the pins PR1_MII0_RXLINK and PR1_MII1_RXLINK are not connected which are required for link detection.
    Only in E3 revision, these connections are available. Therefore this work-around can not be used on E1/E2 revision.
    \endcond

- In Link Polling mode - enabled through sysconfig, we do not require RX_LINK pins for link status update as firmware polls and updates the status.
- Only Clause 22 frame format is supported. Clause 45 frame format is not supported.
- MDIO state machine is disabled and hence MDIO LINK_INT and USER_INT interrupts are NOT available.
