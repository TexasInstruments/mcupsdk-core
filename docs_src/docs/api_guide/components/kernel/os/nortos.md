# NO RTOS {#KERNEL_NORTOS_PAGE}

[TOC]

## Introduction

NORTOS is a SW module that implements APIs which allow the upper layers of SW to run in no-RTOS mode.
i.e without any RTOS. The NO RTOS APIs are implemented underneath the \ref KERNEL_DPL_PAGE APIs. This allows
the device drivers to run either in no-RTOS mode or with a RTOS.

## Features Supported

Common across all CPUs,
- Clock APIs to initialize a system tick ISR and allow SW to create multiple SW timers using a single underlying HW timer.
- Address translate APIs to translate system address to local address, needed for M4F
- Heap APIs to create arbitrary heaps at user defined memory locations
- Semaphore APIs to model a semaphore in no-RTOS environment
- HW Timer APIs to setup user defined HW timers beyond the system tick timer.
- Logging APIs to log to different consoles like UART, CCS, shared memory, CPU local memory, including logging zones to enable/disable logging.

## SysConfig Features

@VAR_SYSCFG_USAGE_NOTE

SysConfig can be used to configure below modules with NORTOS
- Clock module to setup system tick timer including the tick duration
- Debug Log module to select the console to use for logging as well as enable/disable logging zones
- MPU ARMv7 to setup different MPU regions for R5F and M4F CPUs
\cond SOC_AM64X
- MMU ARMV8 to setup different MMU regions for A53 CPU
\endcond
- RAT to setup  address translation regions, needed for M4F
- Timer to setup HW timer available on the SOC, including enabling timer interrupt and ISR registration

## Features Not Supported

- Task APIs are not supported in NORTOS mode. Task APIs necessarily need a RTOS and cannot be used in no-RTOS mode
\cond !SOC_AM62X
- R5F ISRs,
  - FIQ mode,
    - nested interrupts not supported
    - FPU save/restore not supported.
\endcond
- M4F ISRs,
  - FPU save/restore not supported.
\cond SOC_AM64X
- A53 ISRs,
  - FIQ mode ISRs not supported.
- A53 multi-core SMP mode is not supported.
\endcond
