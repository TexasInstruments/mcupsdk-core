# FreeRTOS {#KERNEL_FREERTOS_PAGE}

[TOC]

## Introduction

FreeRTOS is a market-leading real-time operating system (RTOS) for microcontrollers and small microprocessors. Distributed freely under the MIT open source license, FreeRTOS includes a kernel and a growing set of libraries suitable for use across all industry sectors. FreeRTOS is built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of use.

MCU+ SDK supports FreeRTOS on below CPUS
- ARM M4F
\cond !SOC_AM62X
- ARM R5F
\cond SOC_AM64X
- ARM A53 (single core and SMP on both cores)
\endcond
\endcond

## Features Supported {#FREERTOS_SUPPORTED_FEATURES}

- FreeRTOS Kernel @VAR_FREERTOS_KERNEL_VERSION
  - Tasks, semaphores, mutex, queues, timers, list, heap, event groups
  - preemptive priority based scheduler
  - static and/or dynamic memory allocation mode
\cond SOC_AM64X
- FreeRTOS SMP Kernel @VAR_FREERTOS_SMP_KERNEL_VERSION
  - Tasks, semaphores, mutex, queues, timers, list, heap, event groups
  - preemptive priority based scheduler for multiple cores
  - static and/or dynamic memory allocation mode
\endcond
- FreeRTOS+POSIX
  - Limited POSIX API wrappers on top of FreeRTOS APIs
  - Clock, message queue, pthread, pthread cond, pthread mutex, semaphore, timer
- In order to keep the device drivers agnostic of FreeRTOS or NORTOS, additionally below \ref KERNEL_DPL_PAGE APIs are implemented to call FreeRTOS APIs underneath,
  - Clock, task, semaphore, heap, cache, MPU, debug logs, HW interrupts, HW timers
- Floating point save/restore with tasks (make sure to call portTASK_USES_FLOATING_POINT() before using floating point operations )
\cond !SOC_AM62X
- R5F ISRs,
  - IRQ mode,
    - FPU save/restore is supported.
    - Priority based interrupt masking in critical section is supported using configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY, uncomment macro **EN_MAX_SYSCALL_INTR_PRI_CRIT_SECTION** in source/kernel/freertos/portable/TI_ARM_CLANG/ARM_CR5F/portmacro.h to enable.(Disabled by default)
\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX
    - nested interrupts are supported.
\endcond
\endcond
- M4F ISRs,
  - nested interrupts supported
\cond SOC_AM64X
- A53 ISRs,
  - IRQ mode,
    - nested interrupts supported
\endcond

## SysConfig Features

@VAR_SYSCFG_USAGE_NOTE

SysConfig can be used to configure below modules with FreeRTOS
- Clock module, to setup system tick timer including the tick duration
- Debug Log module, to select the console to use for logging as well as enable/disable logging zones
- MPU ARMv7, to setup different MPU regions for R5F and M4F CPUs
\cond SOC_AM64X
- MMU ARMv8, to setup different MMU regions for A53 CPUs
\endcond
- Address Translate module, to setup  address translation regions, needed for M4F
- HW Timer module, to setup HW timer available on the SOC, including enabling timer interrupt and ISR registration

## Features Not Supported

- Co-routines, stream buffer are not enabled and are not compiled by default. Users can add these to the FreeRTOS config and makefile if they want to use these features.
- Tickless IDLE mode
- Task level memory protection wrapper
\cond !SOC_AM62X
- R5F ISRs,
\cond SOC_AM243X || SOC_AM64X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM273X
  - IRQ mode,
    - nested interrupts is disabled, due to issues in some corner cases.
\endcond
  - FIQ mode,
    - nested interrupts not supported
    - FPU save/restore not supported.
\endcond
- M4F ISRs,
  - FPU save/restore not supported.
\cond SOC_AM64X
- A53 ISRs,
  - FPU save/restore not supported.
\endcond

## Important files and directory structure

FreeRTOS source is distributed along with MCU+ SDK and given below are some important files and folders related to FreeRTOS.

In addition to above files, to enable features like HW interrupts, cache, MPU, the FreeRTOS library
in MCU+ SDK also shares some code with NORTOS, see to makefile in the folder `source\kernel\freertos` to see the exact list of files
that are included to build a freertos library.
