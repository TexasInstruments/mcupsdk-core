## Introduction

ThreadX is a high-performance real-time kernel designed specifically for embedded applications.

Unlike other real-time kernels, ThreadX is designed to be versatileâ€”easily scaling among small microcontroller-based applications through those that use powerful CISC, RISC, and DSP processors.

ThreadX is scalable based on its underlying architecture. Because ThreadX services are implemented as a C library, only those services actually used by the application are brought into the run-time image. Hence, the actual size of ThreadX is completely determined by the application. For most applications, the instruction image of ThreadX ranges between 2 KBytes and 15 KBytes in size.

There is SysConfig support for the ThreadX integrated module. To use ThreadX in your application, just add the ThreadX module under `ECLIPSE_THREADX` in the SysConfig panel.
