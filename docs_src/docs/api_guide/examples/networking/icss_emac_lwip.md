# Iperf using LWIP

- Iperf is a tool for network performance measurement and tuning. It is a cross-platform tool that can produce standardized performance measurements for any network. Iperf has client and server functionality, and can create data streams to measure the throughput between the two ends in one or both directions.

- Iperf version to be used is version 2.0.9-win64(on windows) and version 2.+ on linux(Ubuntu 18.04 64bit).

- The lwip app has iperf enabled by default.

- The data streams can be either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

 - UDP: When used for testing UDP capacity, iperf allows the user to specify the datagram size and provides results for the datagram throughput and the packet loss.
 - TCP: When used for testing TCP capacity, iperf measures the throughput of the payload. Iperf uses 1024 × 1024 for mebibytes and 1000 × 1000 for megabytes.

## Important Iperf Arguments:

 Argument      | Meaning
 ---------------|-----------
 -s             | Run server
 -c             | Run Client [Ex: -c 192.168.1.102]
 -u             | UDP
 -b             | Bandwidth [Used in UDP, Ex: 100M M->Mbits]
 -i             | Output interval in Sec [Ex: -i1 1sec interval]
 -t             | Time in sec [Ex: -t60 60sec]
 -p             | Port number [Ex: -p 5555]
 -w             | Windows size [Ex: -w 1M M->Mbits]
 -d             | Bi-directional traffic
 -l             | Length [Ex: -l 1046 1046bytes]
 -V             | Used when IPv6 address is used instead of IPv4


# Steps to Run the Example

## Build the example

- When using CCS projects to build, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- When using makefiles to build, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)

## HW Setup

\note Make sure you have setup the EVM with cable connections as shown here, \ref EVM_SETUP_PAGE.
      In addition do below steps.

## Create a network between EVM and host PC

- The EVM will get an IP address od 192.168.0.200. Make sure to connect the other end of the cable
to a network which is in the same sub-network..

- To get started, create a simple local network
  between the EVM and the host PC as shown below.

  \imageStyle{icss_emac_lwip_example_01.png,width:30%}
  \image html icss_emac_lwip_example_01.png Local network between PC and EVM

- After we run the example on the EVM (next step), the EVM will be assigned the IP address, and then host
  can communicate with the EVM using the assigned IP address.

## Run the example

\attention If you need to reload and run again, a CPU power-cycle is MUST

- Launch a CCS debug session and run the example executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- You will see logs in the UART terminal as shown in the next section.
- Note the IP address seen in the log, this is what we will use to communicate with the EVM.

## Sample output for ICSS-EMAC LWIP example

\cond SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX

\code

UDP server listening on port 5001
link_callback==UP
      6. 39s : CPU load =   0.82 %

\endcode

\endcond

## Communicate with the EVM using ethernet

- Firstly you can try to reach the EVM using ping as shown below, using a command shell on the host PC

        > ping 192.168.0.200

- Next you can run `iperf` tests as shown below. Below steps have been tried with a Windows 10 host PC running.

 - Install `iperf` if not installed by doing below

        > sudo apt install iperf

 - Invoke iperf to test TCP bi-directional RX+TX connection as shown below
    \code
    > iperf -c 192.168.0.200 -i 5 -t 20 -d
    \endcode

## Measuring the throughput using Iperf:

- Once we get the ip after running the example, we can use following iperf command on windows to get the throughput.
	- iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.200 -r

## Troubleshooting issues

- If you see a valid, non-zero MAC address but IP address is `0.0.0.0` then
   - Make sure you see `link_callback==UP` message, if not check the ethernet cable
   - Check the local network and check if the DHCP server is indeed running as expected
   - When using a home broadband/wifi router, its possible to check the clients connected to the DHCP server via a web
     browser. Check your router user manual for more details.
