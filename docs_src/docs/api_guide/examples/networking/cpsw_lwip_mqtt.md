# Introduction

\note LwIP and MbedTLS features are made available as is from the public lwIP and MbedTLS project. SDK configuration may only enable and exercise a subset of these features.
The mbedTLS public project being used here (tag 2.13.1) can be found here: https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.13.1

This example demonstates how to run a MQTT client with TLS enabled on LwIP networking stack using raw API coupled with ethernet driver (ENET), with MbedTLS providing TLS functionality in the L4 layer.

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using CPSW
  - This is a standard ethernet switch + port HW
  - It uses the ethernet driver underneath with LwIP TCP/IP networking stack

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using CPSW as HW mechanism
  - CPSW is a standard ethernet switch + port HW
  - It uses ethernet driver underneath with LwIP TCP/IP networking stack

\endcond

The example does below
- Initializes the ethernet driver for the underlying HW
- Initializes the LwIP stack for TCP/UDP IP.
- Client gets a static IP address and launches the MQTT client connection request.
- Based on the mode selected from app_main.c, the MQTT client acts as a subscriber or publisher
- MQTT broker waits for connection from client on port 1883 (TLS disabled) or port 8883 (TLS enabled).
- When the broker receives a connection request from the MQTT Client (AM2x device), a 2way Auth is completed and both the broker and client are verified by a TLS handshake
- After the handshake is complete, if publisher mode is selected, the client will publish the message entered by user in the console, else it will subscribe to the broker
- This showcases the ability of the TI device to act as an MQTT client and interact with an MQTT broker.
# Supported Combinations

\note In this example, we have used PBUF_RAM to allocate pbufs instead of PBUF_POOLS. This is subject to change in the future releases. The lwip-stack/src/apps/altcp_tls/altcp_tls_mbedtls.c file has also been moved to the example for the aforementioned reason.

# mbedTLS

Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. It is distributed under the Apache License version 2.0. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems. It is known to be easy to understand, use, integrate and expand. The library is designed to integrate with existing (embedded) applications and to provide the building blocks for secure communication, cryptography and key management. It is designed to be as loosely coupled as possible, allowing you to only integrate the parts you need without having overhead from the rest.

 - mbedTLS tag used for this example: mbedtls-2.13.1 (https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.13.1)

# TLS certificates

Here we use self signed openSSL generated certificates for TLS handshake. The steps for generation of certificate are shown below.
The mosquitto broker accepts certificates in PEM (.crt extension) format. The format for client certificates used in the SDK code is DER format in the form of binary data.

The certificates needed here are:
1. Server certificates
2. CA certificartes

The client certificates can be shared across multiple clients. For simplicity we use "1234" as passwords for all the certificates and broker configuration.

\note In this implementation of MQTT client, we have not enabled the file system support. We directly use the certificate's and key's data in binary form. The client_info.h file has both the Certificate, the private key, the CA details and the password. The variables are required by mqtt.c to perform a 2way authentication.

## Generate Certificates

- Create Key pair for Certificate authority (CA).
\code
$ oopenssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 2048
\endcode

- Generate certificate for CA using above key
\code
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 1826 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
\endcode

- Create server key pair for the server, to be used by the broker
\code
$ openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
\endcode

- Create a Certificate Sign Request (csr) for the server
\code
$ openssl req -new -out server.csr -key server.key
\endcode

- Self sign the Server certificates using CA key
\code
$ openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 360
\endcode

- To convert certificates from PEM to DER format. Convert both CA and server certificates
\code
$ openssl x509 -outform der -in ca.pem -out ca.crt
$ openssl rsa -outform der -in ca.key -out ca.key
\endcode

- To convert DER certificates to binary data, this data is used in client_info.h
\code
xxd -i filename.der filename.h
\endcode

\note In case of linux, "/etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates" is the directory where the CA keys and certificates should be placed.
The server certificates should be placed in mosquitto/certs folder.

# Mosquitto Broker Configurations
- Install Mosquitto broker and clients
\code
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
\endcode

- Create a Password file with users, for simplicity, we use "1234" as password for all 3 users
\code
./apps/mosquitto_passwd/mosquitto_passwd -c my_password_file am243x_evm (or any other username)
./apps/mosquitto_passwd/mosquitto_passwd my_password_file pc_sub
./apps/mosquitto_passwd/mosquitto_passwd my_password_file pc_pub
\endcode

- Create your own copy of the ACL file, add all users created above
\code
cp aclfile.example my_aclfile
# Sitara Device client
user am243x_evm (or any other username)
topic topic_qos1

# Linux PC - Subscriber
user pc_sub
topic topic_qos1

# Linux PC - Publisher
user pc_pub
topic topic_qos1
\endcode

- Create your own copy of mosquitto.conf
\code
cp mosquitto.conf my_mosquitto.conf
\endcode

- Make the following changes according to the diff shown below
\code
a0503581@a0503581:~/mosquitto$ diff mosquitto.conf my_mosquitto.conf

\note To run the same example without TLS, the mosquitto.conf file should use port 1883 instead of 8883 and "require_certificates" should be set to false, the capath, certfile path should be removed
# Steps to Run the Example

## Build the example

- When using CCS projects to build, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- When using makefiles to build, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)

## HW Setup

\note Make sure you have setup the EVM with cable connections as shown here, \ref EVM_SETUP_PAGE.
      In addition do below steps.

\cond SOC_AM243X

### AM243X-EVM

#### For CPSW based example

- Connect a ethernet cable to the EVM from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

### AM243X-LP

\note AM243X-LP has two ethernet Ports which can be configured as both CPSW ports.

#### For CPSW based examples

- Connect a ethernet cable to the AM243X-LP from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

\endcond

## Create a network between EVM and host PC

- The EVM will get an IP address statically (192.168.1.3), so make sure to connect the other end of the cable
to a linux PC (192.168.1.2) running the mosquitto broker.

  \imageStyle{mqtt_connections.png,width:45%}
  \image html mqtt_connections.png Local network between PC and EVM

- To check the router connection with host PC, recommend to disconnect all other networking conenctions
  on the PC, sometimes you may need to disable firewall SW, and make sure the IP address of the linux PC is correct.


## Steps to execute

1. On a linux terminal, launch the broker using the command: "./src/mosquitto -c my_mosquitto.conf -v"

2. Run the example on the TI Sitara device (@VAR_SOC_NAME).

2. Try to reach the EVM using ping as shown below, using a command shell on the host PC
    \code
    $ping 192.168.1.3
    \endcode

3. The client (192.168.1.3) will attempt to make a connection with the broker (192.168.1.2) and after the TLS handshake is complete, the broker logs will display a message for new connection

4. In another linux terminal, use the command to publish data to a topic which the client has subscribed to:
   \code
    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./client/mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.2 -u pc_pub -P 1234 -t topic_qos1 --cafile /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/ca.crt  --cert {PATH_TO_BROKER}/mosquitto/certs/server.crt --key {PATH_TO_BROKER}/mosquitto/certs/server.key --debug --insecure --tls-version tlsv1.2 -m "helloworld"
    \endcode

5. The broker and client output has been displayed above.

6. There will be constant PING messages shared between client and broker to keep the connection alive.

\note For MQTT without TLS, use the conf file created for Non TLS broker, Steps 1-3 remain same, for publishing data, use the following command:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./client/mosquitto_pub -h BROKER_IP -u pc_pub -P 1234 -t topic_qos1 -m 'helloworld'
## Sample output for MQTT example

- Sample terminal output (TI device)
  The subscriber connection (named "test" here) received a message on topic (topic_qos1) of lenght 10 ("helloworld")

## Troubleshooting issues

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
- If you see MAC address as `00:00:00:00:00:00`, likely you are using a very early Si sample which does not
  have MAC address "fused" in, in this case do below steps

   - Open file `source/networking/.meta/enet_cpsw/templates/am64x_am243x/enet_soc_cfg.c.xdt`
   - Uncomment below line
        \code
        #define ENET_MAC_ADDR_HACK (TRUE)
        \endcode
   - Rebuild the libraries and examples (\ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
\endcond

- If you see a valid, non-zero MAC address and continuosly seieing "Waiting for network UP..." prints in UART terminal
   - Make sure you see `Enet IF UP Event.` message, if not check the ethernet cable

- If the TLS handshake fails:
   - Make sure the client_info.h file has valid certificates for client and CA and valid password.

- For LwIP related error codes, refer:
   - https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_0_x/group__infrastructure__errors.html

- For MQTT Error codes, refer the file at path:
   - /lwip/lwip-stack/src/include/lwip/apps/mqtt.h

- To check the broker configuration, a mosquitto subscriber and publisher can be used on the linux PC
   - To launch the broker
   \code
    ./src/mosquitto -c my_mosquitto.conf -v
   \endcode

   - To subscribe using mosquitto subscriber
   \code
    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./client/mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.2 -u pc_sub -P 1234 -t topic_qos1 --cafile /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/ca.crt --cert /home/a0503581/mosquitto/certs/server.crt --key /home/a0503581/mosquitto/certs/server.key --debug --insecure --tls-version tlsv1.2
   \endcode

   - To publish using mosquitto publisher
   \code
    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./client/mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.2 -u pc_pub -P 1234 -t topic_qos1 --cafile /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/ca.crt  --cert /home/a0503581/mosquitto/certs/server.crt --key /home/  a0503581/mosquitto/certs/server.key --debug --insecure --tls-version tlsv1.2 -m "helloworld"
   \endcode
