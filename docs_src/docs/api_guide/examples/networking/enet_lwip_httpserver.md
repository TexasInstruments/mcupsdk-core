# Enet LwIP HTTP Server On Bare Metal (No-RTOS){#EXAMPLES_ENET_LWIP_CPSW_HTTPSERVER}

[TOC]

# Introduction

\note LwIP features are made available as is from public lwIP project. SDK configuration may only enable and exercise a subset of these features.

This example shows about how to implement a simple HTTP web Server on LwIP networking stack using LwIP raw APIs on bare metal (No-RTOS) using no-rtos LwIP stack, no-rtos lwip-if and enet driver.

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using CPSW peripheral
  - CPSW is a IEEE 802.3 standard ethernet switch + port peripheral
  - It uses ethernet driver underneath with LwIP TCP/IP networking stack
  - CPSW can be configured in two modes: Switch or MAC. For more details, \ref ENET_LWIP_CPSW_OPERATING_MODES

The example does below
- Initializes the ethernet driver for the underlying HW
- Initializes the 'NO_SYS' compiled LwIP and register  event callbacks.
- Start polling for events such as Receive packets, timer event, transmit done, stack event etc.
- Web server waits for any HTTP client to send  HTTP GET request on default HTTP port and sends the HTML page as a HTTP GET response

# Configuring Syscfg

- Select NoRTOS in 'TI Networking' -> 'CPSW' -> 'System Integration Config' -> 'RTOS Variant'
  \imageStyle{enet_nortos.png,width:45%}
  \image html enet_nortos.png NoRTOS selection

- Following Syscfg option allows flexibility to configure memory foot print based on required use case like: Number of DMA descriptors and buffering.

- Supported Options with default configuration

# Steps to Run the Example

## Build the example

- When using CCS projects to build, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- When using makefiles to build, note the required combination and build using make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Note to use the no-rtos variants of libraries for lwipif, lwip, notos (dpl).

## HW Setup

\note Make sure you have setup the EVM with cable connections as shown here, \ref EVM_SETUP_PAGE.
      In addition do below steps.

\cond SOC_AM64X

### AM64X-EVM

#### For CPSW based example

- Connect a ethernet cable to the EVM from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM243X

### AM243X-EVM

#### For CPSW based example

- Connect a ethernet cable to the EVM from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

### AM243X-LP

\note AM243X-LP has two ethernet Ports which can be configured as both CPSW ports.

#### For CPSW based examples

- Connect a ethernet cable to the AM243X-LP from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

\endcond

## Create a network between EVM and host PC

- The EVM will get an IP address using DHCP, so make sure to connect the other end of the cable
to a network which has a DHCP server running.

- To get started one can create a simple local network
  between the EVM and the host PC by using a home broadband/wifi router as shown below.
  Most such routers run a DHCP server

  \imageStyle{lwip_example_01.png,width:30%}
  \image html lwip_example_01.png Local network between PC and EVM

- To check the router connection with host PC, recommend to disconnect all other networking conenctions
  on the PC, sometimes you may need to disable firewall SW, and make sure the router is able
  to assign a IP address to your host PC

- After we run the example on the EVM (next step), the EVM will similarly be assigned a IP address, and then host
  can communicate with the EVM using the assigned IP address.

## Run the example

\attention If you need to reload and run again, a CPU power-cycle is MUST

- Launch a CCS debug session and run the example executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- You will see logs in the UART terminal as shown in the next section.
- Note the IP address seen in the log, this is what we will use to communicate with the EVM.


## Sample output for CPSW example

\code
  CPSW LWIP HTTP WEB SERVER
==========================
EnetPhy_bindDriver:1718
PHY 0 is alive
Starting lwIP, local interface IP is dhcp-enabled
Host MAC address-0 : f4:84:4c:fc:33:80
[LWIPIF_LWIP] NETIF INIT SUCCESS
Enet IF UP Event. Local interface IP:0.0.0.0
Cpsw_handleLinkUp:1323
MAC Port 1: link up
Network Link UP Event
Enet IF UP Event. Local interface IP:192.168.1.10
Network is UP ...

\endcode

## Steps to execute

1. Run example on EVM

2. Try to reach the EVM using ping as shown below, using a command shell on the host PC
    \code
    $ping 192.168.1.10
    \endcode
    "192.168.1.10" should be replaced with IP of EVM.

3. Open web browser in host PC that is on the network. Type http://192.168.1.10/index.html ("192.168.1.10" should be replaced with IP of EVM) and observe that page loads successfully, with HTTP 200 response code.

## Troubleshooting issues

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
- If you see MAC address as `00:00:00:00:00:00`, likely you are using a very early Si sample which does not
  have MAC address "fused" in, in this case do below steps

   - Open file `source/networking/.meta/enet_cpsw/templates/am64x_am243x/enet_soc_cfg.c.xdt`
   - Uncomment below line
        \code
        #define ENET_MAC_ADDR_HACK (TRUE)
        \endcode
   - Rebuild the libraries and examples (\ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
\endcond

- If you see a valid, non-zero MAC address and continuosly seeing "Waiting for network UP..." prints in UART terminal
   - Make sure you see `Enet IF UP Event.` message, if not check the ethernet cable
   - Check the local network and check if the DHCP server is indeed running as expected
   - When using a home broadband/wifi router, its possible to check the clients connected to the DHCP server via a web
     browser. Check your router user manual for more details.
