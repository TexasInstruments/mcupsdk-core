# Enet ICSSG Loopback Example {#EXAMPLES_ENET_ICSSG_LOOPBACK}

[TOC]

# Introduction


This example exercises the PHY loopback functionality of the external PHY (layer1) SoC. The ICSSG peripheral is opened with ethernet initialization (in MAC only mode) parameters and the PHY loopback is enabled.
Note that ICSSG pheripheral does not support MAC loopback mode, unlike CPSW.

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using ICSSG Hardware peripheral
- ICSS
  - This is a firmware enabled ethernet switch + port HW
  - This HW can be used with industrial communication protocols as well (see \ref EXAMPLES_INDUSTRIAL_COMMS)
  - In this example we use ICSS as a standard ethernet port


The examples do below
- A Tx channel and a Rx flow are opened to enable data transfers. Packets are transmitted from the Switch R5F (Main R5F0_0) to the host port using the Tx channel. These packets are routed back to the host port by the switch hardware as the internal loopback feature is enabled. These packets are then transmitted to the Switch R5F by the Rx flow and the application is notified.
- The Tx and Rx functions in the example are set to transmit and receive 1000 packets. After reaching the count of 1000, the application closes the Tx channel, Rx flow, ICSSG and restarts the application for a configurable number of times. Restarting the loopback test application ensures that there arenâ€™t any memory leaks, and the hardware is closed properly and can be reopened any time.

# Steps to Run the Example

## Build the example

- When using CCS projects to build, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- When using makefiles to build, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
