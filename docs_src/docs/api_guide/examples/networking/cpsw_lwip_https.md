# CPSW Lwip HTTPS Server Example{#EXAMPLES_CPSW_LWIP_HTTPS}

[TOC]

# Introduction

\note LwIP and MbedTLS features are made available as is from the public lwIP and MbedTLS project. SDK configuration may only enable and exercise a subset of these features.

This example demonstates how to run a HTTPS server on LwIP networking stack using raw API coupled with ethernet driver (ENET), with MbedTLS providing TLS functionality in the L4 layer.

The mbedTLS public project being used here (tag 2.13.1) can be found here: https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.13.1

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using CPSW
  - This is a standard ethernet switch + port HW
  - It uses the ethernet driver underneath with LwIP TCP/IP networking stack

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM273X || SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM263X

On @VAR_SOC_NAME, we can do ethernet based communication using CPSW as HW mechanism
  - CPSW is a standard ethernet switch + port HW
  - It uses ethernet driver underneath with LwIP TCP/IP networking stack

\endcond

The example does below
- Initializes the ethernet driver for the underlying HW
- Initializes the LwIP stack for TCP/UDP IP.
- Gets an IP address assigned through DHCP and launches the HTTPS server.
- HTTPS Server waits for connection from client on port 443.
- On a client request coming from web browser, it uses MbedTLS to verify and complete TLS handshake.
- HTTPS Server completes the handshake and sends back an "index.html" webpage back to client at the address {https://IP_ADDR/index.html}.
- This showcases the ability of the TI device to act as an HTTPS server
# Supported Combinations

\note In this implementation of HTTPS server, we have used PBUF_RAM to allocate pbufs instead of PBUF_POOLS. This is subject to change in the future releases. The lwip-stack/src/apps/altcp_tls/altcp_tls_mbedtls.c file has also been moved out to the example for the aforementioned reason.

# mbedTLS

Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. It is distributed under the Apache License version 2.0. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems. It is known to be easy to understand, use, integrate and expand. The library is designed to integrate with existing (embedded) applications and to provide the building blocks for secure communication, cryptography and key management. It is designed to be as loosely coupled as possible, allowing you to only integrate the parts you need without having overhead from the rest.

 - mbedTLS tag used for this example: mbedtls-2.13.1 (https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.13.1)

# TLS certificates used

Here we use self signed openSSL generated certificates for TLS handshake. The steps for generation of certificate are shown below
## Certificate Authority

- Generate unencrypted 2048-bits RSA private key for the certificate authority (CA).

\code
$ openssl genrsa -out ca-prk.pem 2048
\endcode

- Generate certificate signing request (CSR) for the CA

\code
$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key ca-prk.pem -out ca-csr.pem -subj "/C={country}/ST={state}/L={locality}/O={organization} CA"
\endcode

- Self-sign the CSR and to generate a certificate for the CA

\code
$ openssl x509 -req -signkey ca-prk.pem -in ca-csr.pem -out ca-cer.pem -days 365
\endcode

## Server Certificates

- Generate unencrypted 2048-bits RSA private key for the server (CA)
\code
$ openssl genrsa -out server-prk.pem 2048
\endcode

- Generate CSR for the server
\code
$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key server-prk.pem -out server-csr.pem -subj "/C={country}/ST={state}/L={locality}/O={organization}/CN={common name, ex. 127.0.0.1}"
\endcode

## Certificate Authority (Self signing)

- View the server CSR and verify its content:
\code
$ openssl req -in server-csr.pem -noout -text
\endcode

- Sign the server CSR
\code
$ openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server-csr.pem -CA ca-cer.pem -CAkey ca-prk.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cer.pem -days 365
\endcode

- Convert .pem and .key files to byte array. This will produce a header file with the byte array of certificate/key and the size of the array
\code
$ xxd -i server-csr.pem byte_array.h
\endcode

\note In this implementation of HTTPS server, we have not enabled the file system support. We directly use the certificate's and key's data as hex dump array. The server_certificates.h file has both the Certificate and the private key. The variable 'Certificate' is the hex dump of certificate.pem and the variable 'PrivateKey' is the hex dump of key.pem.

# Steps to Run the Example

## Build the example

- When using CCS projects to build, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- When using makefiles to build, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)

## HW Setup

\note Make sure you have setup the EVM with cable connections as shown here, \ref EVM_SETUP_PAGE.
      In addition do below steps.


\cond SOC_AM243X

### AM243X-EVM

#### For CPSW based example

- Connect a ethernet cable to the EVM from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am64x_evm_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

### AM243X-LP

\note AM243X-LP has two ethernet Ports which can be configured as both CPSW ports.

#### For CPSW based examples

- Connect a ethernet cable to the AM243X-LP from host PC as shown below

  \imageStyle{am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png,width:30%}
  \image html am243x_lp_lwip_example_00.png Ethernet cable for CPSW based ethernet

\endcond

## Create a network between EVM and host PC

- The EVM will get an IP address using DHCP, so make sure to connect the other end of the cable
to a network which has a DHCP server running.

- To get started one can create a simple local network
  between the EVM and the host PC by using a home broadband/wifi router as shown below.
  Most such routers run a DHCP server

  \imageStyle{lwip_example_01.png,width:30%}
  \image html lwip_example_01.png Local network between PC and EVM

- To check the router connection with host PC, recommend to disconnect all other networking conenctions
  on the PC, sometimes you may need to disable firewall SW, and make sure the router is able
  to assign a IP address to your host PC

- After we run the example on the EVM (next step), the EVM will similarly be assigned a IP address, and then host
  can communicate with the EVM using the assigned IP address.

## Run the example

\attention If you need to reload and run again, a CPU power-cycle is MUST

- Launch a CCS debug session and run the example executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- You will see logs in the UART terminal as shown in the next section.
- Note the IP address seen in the log, this is what we will use to communicate with the EVM via a Web Browser. The address in this case is https://192.168.1.2/index.html

## Sample output for CPSW example

- Sample output of client (web browser)

  \imageStyle{cpsw_lwip_https_server.png,width:80%}
  \image html cpsw_lwip_https_server.png Client web browser connected to HTTPS server

## Steps to execute

1. Run example on EVM

2. Try to reach the EVM using ping as shown below, using a command shell on the host PC
    \code
    $ping 192.168.1.2
    \endcode
    "192.168.1.2" should be replaced with IP of EVM.

3. To start the client on host PC, open a web browser of your choice and enter url https://IP_ADDR/index.html
   Replace IP_ADDR with the EVM IP assigned during run-time.
   The above has been tried with google chrome, microsoft edge, mozilla firefox.

4. The lwIP home page will load with the title "lwip -  A Lightweight TCP/IP Stack"

5. To close the connection, simply close the tab in the web broswer.

## Troubleshooting issues

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
- If you see MAC address as `00:00:00:00:00:00`, likely you are using a very early Si sample which does not
  have MAC address "fused" in, in this case do below steps

   - Open file `source/networking/.meta/enet_cpsw/templates/am64x_am243x/enet_soc_cfg.c.xdt`
   - Uncomment below line
        \code
        #define ENET_MAC_ADDR_HACK (TRUE)
        \endcode
   - Rebuild the libraries and examples (\ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
\endcond

- If you see a valid, non-zero MAC address and continuosly seieing "Waiting for network UP..." prints in UART terminal
   - Make sure you see `Enet IF UP Event.` message, if not check the ethernet cable
   - Check the local network and check if the DHCP server is indeed running as expected
   - When using a home broadband/wifi router, its possible to check the clients connected to the DHCP server via a web
     browser. Check your router user manual for more details.

- If you see "address cannot be reached" message in the client browser,
   - Make sure you see the `Enet IF UP Event` message, if not check the connection of router, host PC and EVM
   - Make sure a valid Local Interface IP is assigned.

- If the client fails at loading index.html
   - Make sure the certificate is valid and the hex dump is loaded correctly for certificate and key in server_certificates.h files
