## Introduction

This example acts as a getting started point for PRU firmware development in assembly. It is a demo that shows how to access local memory locations of PRU.

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project from the above mentioned Example folder path for R5F and PRU, After this `main.asm`, `linker.cmd` files gets copied to ccs workspace of PRU project. The `main.asm` contains sample code for accessing Local PRU memories available: DMEM0 (64kB), DMEM1 (64kB) and Shared Ram (64kB).

- Build the PRU project using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
     - Build Flow: Once you click on build in PRU project, firmware header file which is generated in release or debug folder of ccs workspace, is moved to  `<sdk-install-dir/examples/pru_io/empty/firmware/device/>`

- Build the R5F project using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
     - Firmware header file path is included in R5F project include options by default, Instructions in Firmware header file can be written into PRU IRAM memory using \ref PRUICSS_loadFirmware API call
     - Build Flow: Once you click on build in R5F project, SysConfig files are generated, Finally the R5F project will be generated using both the generated SysConfig and PRU project binaries.
     - Note: The PRU project won't run independently as it is dependent on SysConfig files generated by the R5F project to intialize pru.

    \note
    Prerequisite: [PRU-CGT-2-3](https://www.ti.com/tool/PRU-CGT) (ti-pru-cgt) should be installed at: `C:/ti/`

- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE

# Writing PRU code

* You can modify this example to write your own firmware. `<sdk-install-dir/examples/pru_io/adc/>` contains some PRU projects which can act as reference. PRU sources are usually separated out in a `firmware/` subfolder in all these example project folders.
* You can change the core in project properties to develop firmware for other PRU cores.

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X

* You can modify this example to write your own firmware. `<sdk-install-dir/examples/pru_io/sent/>` contains some PRU projects which can act as reference. PRU sources are usually separated out in a `firmware/` subfolder in all these example project folders.
* You can change the core in project properties to develop firmware for other PRU cores.
