# Empty Project {#EXAMPLES_PRU_EMPTY}

[TOC]

## Introduction

This example acts as a getting started point for PRU firmware development in assembly. It is a demo that shows how to access local memory locations of PRU.

# Supported Combinations

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project from the above mentioned Example folder path for R5F (It will automatically import PRU project). After this you should see two linked files in pru project: `main.asm` and `linker.cmd`. The `main.asm` contains sample code for accessing Local PRU memories available: DMEM0 (64kB), DMEM1 (64kB) and Shared Ram (64kB).

- Build only the R5F project using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
     - Build Flow: Once you click on build in R5F project, first, SysConfig files are generated, then the PRU project is compiled according to the configurations set in SysConfig. Finally the R5F project will be generated using both the generated SysConfig and PRU project binaries.
     - Note: The PRU project won't run independently as it is dependent on SysConfig files generated by the R5F project to intialize pru.

    \note
    Prerequisite: [PRU-CGT-2-3](https://www.ti.com/tool/PRU-CGT) (ti-pru-cgt) should be installed at: `C:/ti/`

- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE

# Writing PRU code

* You can modify this example to write your own firmware. `<sdk-install-dir/examples/pru_io/adc/>` contains some PRU projects which can act as reference. PRU sources are usually separated out in a `firmware/` subfolder in all these example project folders.
* You can change the core in project properties to develop firmware for other PRU cores.

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM263X

* You can modify this example to write your own firmware. `<sdk-install-dir/examples/pru_io/sent/>` contains some PRU projects which can act as reference. PRU sources are usually separated out in a `firmware/` subfolder in all these example project folders.
* You can change the core in project properties to develop firmware for other PRU cores.
