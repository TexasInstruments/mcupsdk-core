# Introduction


- This demo provides a means of measuring the performance of a realistic application where the text of the application is sitting in various memory locations and the data is sitting in On-Chip-Memory RAM (referred to as OCM, OCMC or OCMRAM).
- The application executes 10 different configurations of the same text varying by data vs. instruction cache intensity. Each test calls 16 separate functions 500 total times in random order.
- The most instruction intensive example achieves a instruction cache miss rate (ICM/sec) of ~3-4 million per second when run entirely from OCMRAM. This is a rate that we have similarly seen in real-world customer examples.
- More data intensive tests have more repetitive code, achieving much lower ICM rates.

Please read more on smart placement at \ref SMART_PLACEMENT, before moving further ahead.

In this example,`annotations.S` is an assembly file that contains annotations.

Assembly annotations is being used for easier implementation.

`annotations.S` has a macro named `ENABLE_SMART_PLACEMENT_ANNOTATION` which can be used to enable and disable annotations which will effectively enable and disable smart placement.

Here it will be shown how code performance (or CPI) is improved with smart placement.

# Building benchmark application

To build this application, compiler ti-cgt-armllvm >= 3.1.0 is required. Please make sure that `CGT_TI_ARM_CLANG_PATH` variable in imports.mak points to correct path of the compiler. Once this basic path is setup then compiling this program can be achieved using make command.

# Running benchmark application

This particular application is used to show the effect of smart placement. To do this, we first remove `ENABLE_SMART_PLACEMENT_ANNOTATION` macro (which is in `annotations.S` file.) and compile it.

After running the application, console logs prints out in the above table format with different configuration like `Mem Cpy Size` i.e. for different values of `Mem Cpy Size`, `exec time` and `ICM/sec` (among with others) is printed. For example,

So from the above, `mem Cpy Size` is changing, ICM is almost same but `Exec Time in Usec` is increasing which is thereby changing `ICM/sec`. Here to find the base line, `Exec Time in Usec` should be selected for the case where `ICM/sec` is 3 (or ~3Millions Instruction Cache Miss/Sec) and from the above data, it can be determined that when `mem Cpy Size` is 2000, `ICM/sec` was 3 and for this, it took 28432 us to execute the application. Therefore, 28432 us is our baseline number.


Now after this, `ENABLE_SMART_PLACEMENT_ANNOTATION` macro is defined again and example is compiled back.

running that would give similar logs and execution time against the `Mem Cpy Size` of 2000 is to be noted and has been measured out to be 25758 us. Following table shows the same:

Mem Cpy Size | INST/sec          | Exec Time in Usec without Smart Placement | Exec Time in Usec with Smart Placement
-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------
 0000         | 7333192           | 11867                                     | 9424
 0100         | 7002172           | 12428                                     | 10057
 0200         | 6627799           | 13130                                     | 10653
 0400         | 5958031           | 14606                                     | 12105
 1000         | 4509122           | 18367                                     | 15924
 1500         | 3647140           | 23678                                     | 21222
 2000         | 3026765           | 28432                                     | 25758
 2250         | 2827058           | 31236                                     | 28583


Therefore, with smart placement code was executed in 25758us and without smart placement same code executed in 28432us which corresponds to performance gain of 10% without changing of any code.
