# EtherCAT SubDevice Setup with TwinCAT {#ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT}

## Creating TwinCAT Project {#ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT_PROJECT_CREATION}

- Install TwinCAT3. A 7 days free trial license is available for free download from the [Beckhoff's website](http://www.beckhoff.co.in/english.asp?download/tc3-download-xae.htm). Select the eXtended Automation Engineering (XAE) mode of installation.

- Copy the ESI file to `{TWINCAT_INSTALL_DIR}\TwinCAT\3.1\Config\Io\EtherCAT` folder.
    - ESI file for EtherCAT SubDevice application based on ETG stack is `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/source/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave/beckhoff_stack/esi/TI_ESC.xml`

- Start the TwinCAT XAE Shell application.

- Create a new TwinCAT XAE Project (XML format) by going to "File -> New -> Project -> TwinCAT Project"

    \image html EtherCAT_SubDevice_TwinCAT_Project_Create.PNG "Creating a new TwinCAT Project"

- Go to "TwinCAT -> Show Realtime Ethernet Compatible Devices" and install TwinCAT RT Ethernet intermediate driver. For best performance, it is recommended to use a compatible NIC card listed in [Supported network controllers](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/tc3_overview/9309844363.html&id=1489698440745036069) . For the first time only you need to do this for the PC's Ethernet port, which is used as the EtherCAT port. Go to "TwinCAT -> Show Realtime Ethernet Compatible Devices" and check if the ethernet adapter is listed below "Installed and ready to use devices" before attempting to scan the SubDevice

- Choose Yes to generate mapping after modifying configuration, click on OK to "Activate Configuration?", and Yes to Restart in RUN mode.

## Testing Cable Redundancy {#ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT_CABLE_REDUNDANCY}

Cable redundancy is a feature which ensures that all SubDevices are accessible even if there is a single link break in the network between two ports of MainDevice. We need to ports of MainDevice for testing this feature.

It can be tested as follows:

- Launch TwinCAT XAE Shell application and discover all the SubDevices in SubDevice chain. Here, we used two devices in the chain. The connections should be made as below:
    - MainDevice Port 0 to IN/Port0 of first device
    - OUT/Port1 of first device to IN/Port0 of second device
    - OUT/Port1 of second device to MainDevice Port 1

- The topology can be verified by selecting a "Device" (Double click on "Device") and then selecting the "EtherCAT" tab and click on "Topology". It is also possible to use Beckhoff CU2508 (Real-time Ethernet port multiplier) if you do not have two ports available on MainDevice. You can connect CU2508 to PC running TwinCAT, and use two ports of CU2508 to connect to two EtherCAT SubDevice devices.

  In our case, we have used CU2508 , therefore you see three devices (one CU2508 and two SubDevice devices) between MainDevice ports in the image below.

    \image html EtherCAT_SubDevice_Redundancy_Topology.PNG

- Configure the redundancy mode in TwinCAT. Available options are described in [Redundancy Mode](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/tc3_io_intro/1446583307.html&id=8240898519565691463) section of TwinCAT 3 documentation. Please refer to [Setting up: Device EtherCAT with cable redundancy](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/english.php?content=../content/1033/cu2508/2129825163.html&id=) for details on redundancy mode options to be used with CU2508.

- Activate DC mode as shown in \ref ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT_DC_MODE_TESTING.

- Ensure that both devices are in OP state. It can be displayed by selecting the "Device" (Double click on "Device") and then selecting the "Online" tab.

    \image html EtherCAT_SubDevice_Redundancy_Before_link_break.PNG

- Break the link between OUT/Port1 of first device and IN/Port0 of second device. Both devices should still be in OP state.

    \image html EtherCAT_SubDevice_Redundancy_After_link_break.PNG

\note For this feature to work, `enhancedlink_enable` of \ref bsp_params should be set to \ref TIESC_MDIO_RX_LINK_ENABLE while initializing the EtherCAT SubDevice FWHAL. This configuration is done in `tiesc_socParamsInit()` in tiescsoc.c file.

## Generating ESI Header file From ESI XML file

[EtherCAT SubDevice Beckhoff SSC Example](\ref EXAMPLES_INDUSTRIAL_COMMS_ETHERCAT_SLAVE_BECKHOFF_SSC_DEMO) is expected to be used with `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/source/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave/beckhoff_stack/esi/TI_ESC.xml` file. If the application is modified to work with a different ESI XML file, user will need to update the corresponding ESI header file (tiesc_eeprom.h) and rebuild the application project.

- Generate the binary file equivalent to ESI XML file:
    - Configure TwinCAT as mentioned in \ref ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT_PROJECT_CREATION and \ref ETHERCAT_SUBDEVICE_DEMO_TWINCAT_SCANNING_SUBDEVICE.
    - Click on the TI Box. Select "EtherCAT" Tab. Click on the "Advanced Settings" button.
    - Select "ESC Access -> E2PROM -> Hex Editor". Select "Write to File" and save the binary as a ".bin" file.

\note Please make sure that "Upload" button is not clicked any time during this step. It will load the EEPROM data from TI ESC to TwinCAT memory.

- Convert the binary file to header file using the bin2c tool. This tool can be found in `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/bin2c` folder. Example usage is shown below.
  \code
  python ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/tools/bin2c/bin2c.py "Box 1 (TIESC-004).bin" new_tiesc_eeprom.c new_tiesc_eeprom
  \endcode

\cond SOC_AM64X

- Replace the contents within `"const unsigned char tiesc_eeprom[]"` array in `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave_beckhoff_ssc_demo/@VAR_BOARD_NAME_LOWER/tiesc_eeprom.h` file with the data generated in `new_tiesc_eeprom.h` file within the brackets following `"#define NEW_TIESC_EEPROM"`.

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM243X

- For AM243X-EVM, replace the contents within `"const unsigned char tiesc_eeprom[]"` array in `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave_beckhoff_ssc_demo/@VAR_BOARD_NAME_LOWER/tiesc_eeprom.h` file with the data generated in `new_tiesc_eeprom.h` file within the brackets following `"#define NEW_TIESC_EEPROM"`.

- For AM243X-LP, replace the contents within `"const unsigned char tiesc_eeprom[]"` array in `${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples/industrial_comms/ethercat_slave_beckhoff_ssc_demo/@VAR_LP_BOARD_NAME_LOWER/tiesc_eeprom.h` file with the data generated in `new_tiesc_eeprom.h` file within the brackets following `"#define NEW_TIESC_EEPROM"`.

\endcond

\note Please do not directly replace the existing `tiesc_eeprom.h` file with new header file.

- Rebuild the application.

\cond SOC_AM64X || SOC_AM243X
