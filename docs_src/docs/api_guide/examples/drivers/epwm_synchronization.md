# Introduction

This example configures 6 instances of EPWM, with EPWM0 taken as the reference and the other
five EPWM instances are phase shifted with respect to it. EPWM0, EPWM1, EPWM2 and EPWM3 are configured
using Sysconfig while EPWM4 and EPWM5 are configured using a function. Additionally, functions are defined
that can change the phase and duty cycle of EPWMs while they are running. In this example synchronization is achieved by providing the
sync-out pulse of EPWM0 as the sync-in pulse to EPWM1, EPWM2, EPWM3, EPWM4 and EPWM5. On receiving this sync-in pulse
the EPWM time-base counter will start counting from the phase shift value up until period value. Further, 6 ECAP
modules are integrated in capture mode to capture the waveform in order to validate the synchronization results.
These ECAP modules are also synchronized wherein the sync-in pulse are provided by the sync-out pulse of EPWM0, and they are
configured to detect the event of falling edge in the EPWM waveforms

The sync-in options available are:
 1. EPWMx sync-out signal where x=0,1,2..23
 2. ECAPx sync-out signal where x=0,1,2..9
 3. Input XBAR outx signal where x=4,20
 4. TimeSync xbar pwm output x signal where x=0,1
 5. FSIRX0 Trigger x signal x=0,1,2,3
 6. FSIRX1 Trigger x signal x=0,1,2,3
 7. FSIRX2 Trigger x signal x=0,1,2,3
 8. FSIRX3 Trigger x signal x=0,1,2,3

The sync-out event options available are:
 1. Software force generated EPWM sync-out pulse
 2. Counter zero event
 3. Counter equal to CMPB event
 4. Counter equal to CMPC event
 5. Counter equal to CMPD event
 6. DCA Event 1 Sync signal generates EPWM sync-out pulse
 7. DCB Event 1 Sync signal generates EPWM sync-out pulse
 8. Combination of one or more of above sources

 For this example, we have configured EPWM0 sync-out signal to be the sync-in pulse for EPWM1, EPWM2, EPWM3, EPWM4, EPWM5. This sync-out pulse
 is generated at the counter zero event of EPWM0. Once the other modules receive this sync-in pulse, their counter will be
 at the phase value configured which is 300 for EPWM1, 600 for EPWM2, 900 for EPWM3, 450 for EPWM4, 750 for EPWM5. Also the six ECAP modules are synchronized
 with EPWM0, by configuring their sync-in source as EPWM0 sync-out signal. The phase values for all the ECAP modules are configured to be 0.
 In this example, the configurations for EPWM0, EPWM1, EPWM2 and EPWM3 are done through SysConfig while the configurations for EPWM4 and EPWM5 are done through
 the function AppEpwmInit in the C file. Further two more functions namely AppEpwmDutyCycleUpdate and AppEpwmPhaseUpdate are defined to update the duty cycle and
 phase of already running PWM waveforms.
 Here, the load from Shadow to Active registers occur when the time-base counter reaches zero. This event varies depending on the counter-mode we have set for our EPWM
 modules. If the counter mode is up-count/down-count then this event occurs only once. When the counter mode is up-down count then this event occurs two times.
