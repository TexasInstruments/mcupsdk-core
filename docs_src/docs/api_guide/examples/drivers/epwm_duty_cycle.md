# EPWM Duty Cycle {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_EPWM_DUTY_CYCLE}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example generates a signal for a specified time and duty cycle using
ePWM module. The time and duty cycle can be configured by the user.

The example does the below
\if SOC_AM273X
- Configures ePWMA to generate a 1KHz signal with 25% duty cycle for 60 seconds.
- Output channel 0 is used in the example.
\else
- Configures ePWM0 to generate a 1KHz signal with 25% duty cycle for 60 seconds.
- Output channel A is used in the example.
\endif
- The parameters frequency, duty cycle and application run time are configurable by the user.
- Deadband submodule and chopper submodule are entirely bypassed in this example.
- ISR is used to keep track of keep track of elapsed time.
- Show usage of ePWM APIs
\cond SOC_AM64X
- To probe ePWM output you need to have IO breakout board..
- Short Pin 2 and 3 of J11 on IO break out board.
- Signal can be probed on Pin 7 of J6 on IO break out board.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AM243X

## AM243X-EVM
- To probe ePWM output you need to have IO breakout board..
- Short Pin 2 and 3 of J11 on IO break out board.
- Signal can be probed on Pin 7 of J6 on IO break out board.

## AM243X-LP
- Signal can be probed on Pin 1 of J2 header on am243x-lp board.
  You need to probe J4 Pin 40 which corresponds to Pin 1 of J2 header.

\endcond

\cond SOC_AM273X

## AM273X-EVM
- Signal can be probed on R81 resistor on am273x board.
\endcond

\cond SOC_AWR294X

## AWR294X-EVM
- Signal can be probed on R81 resistor on awr294x board.
\endcond

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- To probe the ePWM output please refer setup details as mentioned above in Introduction section
