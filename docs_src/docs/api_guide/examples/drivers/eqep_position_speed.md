# Introduction

Position and Speed Measurement Using eQEP

This example provides position and speed measurement using the
capture unit and speed measurement using unit time out of the eQEP module.
ePWM and a GPIO are configured to generate simulated eQEP signals. The
ePWM module will interrupt once every period and call the position/speed
calculation function. This example uses the IQMath library to simplify
high-precision calculations.

The configuration for this example is as follows
- Maximum speed is configured to 6000rpm (baseRPM)
- Minimum speed is assumed at 10rpm for capture pre-scalar selection
- Pole pair is configured to 2 (polePairs)
- Encoder resolution is configured to 4000 counts/revolution (mechScaler)
- Which means: 4000 / 4 = 1000 line/revolution quadrature encoder
  (simulated by ePWM)
- ePWM (simulating QEP encoder signals) is configured for a 5kHz frequency
  or 300 rpm (= 4 * 5000 cnts/sec * 60 sec/min) / 4000 cnts/rev)

SPEEDRPM_FR: High Speed Measurement is obtained by counting the QEP
input pulses for 10ms (unit timer set to 100Hz).

SPEEDRPM_FR = (Position Delta / 10ms) * 60 rpm

SPEEDRPM_PR: Low Speed Measurement is obtained by measuring time period
of QEP edges. Time measurement is averaged over 64 edges for better results
and the capture unit performs the time measurement using pre-scaled SYSCLK.

Note that the pre-scaler for capture unit clock is selected such that the
capture timer does not overflow at the required minimum frequency.

This example waits for 10 iterations of unit time out event and verifies the
measured speed:  295 < posSpeed.speedRPMFR < 305

 - posSpeed.speedRPMFR - Speed meas. in rpm using QEP position counter
 - posSpeed.speedRPMPR - Speed meas. in rpm using capture unit
 - posSpeed.thetaMech  - Motor mechanical angle (Q15)
 - posSpeed.thetaElec  - Motor electrical angle (Q15)

# External connections
