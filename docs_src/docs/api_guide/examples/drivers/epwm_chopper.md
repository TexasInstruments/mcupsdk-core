# EPWM Chopper {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_EPWM_CHOPPER}

[TOC]

# Chopper Submodule 
 The PWM chopper submodule allows a high-frequency carrier signal to modulate the PWM waveform generated by the action-qualifier and dead-band submodules. This capability is important if pulse transformer-based gate drivers to control the power switching elements are needed.

Key Funcitonalities include...
 - Programmable chopping (carrier) frequency 
 - Programmable pulse width of first pulse
 - Programmable duty cycle of second and subsequent pulses
 - Can be fully bypassed if not required

# Example Description
 this example demonstrates the Chopper functionality of EPWM. 
Configurations
1. EPWM 0 (EPWM_NO_CHOPPER)
 - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
 - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 
2. EPWM 1 (EPWM_CHOPPER_1_8TH)
 - Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
     - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
     - Chopper Duty Cycle : 1/8
 - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 
3. EPWM 2 (EPWM_CHOPPER_6_8TH)
 - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
     - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
     - Chopper Duty Cycle : 2/3
 - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 
4. EPWM 3 (EPWM_CHOPPER_4_8TH_WITH_DB)
 - No Chopper enabled (Chopper bypassed) 
     - first Pulse width 8/(EPWMCLK/16)
     - Chopper Duty Cycle : 1/2
 - 50% duty Cycle with Period 100 uS 
 - DeadBand added.
     - output A is RED with 50 EPWM TBCLKs
     - output B is FED with 50 EPWM TBCLKs
 
## External Connections
1. Probe EPWM 0A for Reference waveform 
2. Probe EPWM 1A,2A,3A,3B for the Chopper enabled waveforms.
### On AM263x CC/ AM263Px CC with HSEC Dock, 
Probe HSEC pins 49,53,50,54,56 respectively for EPWM 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B
### On AM263x LP/ AM263Px LP,
Probe J4 11, J2 37, J2 39, J6 77, J6 78 respectively for EPWM 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B
