# ADC Singleshot {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_ADC_SINGLESHOT}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example uses ADC to convert all channels and store the results in
the FIFO. After this all the results are printed to the console.

The example does the below
- Configure the ADC to convert all the eight input channels.
- ADC is configured in single shot mode.
- ADC performs averaging of 16 samples to get the conversion result.
- All the conversion results are stored in FIFO0.
- After completion of all conversions, the results are read from the FIFO and displayed to the console.
- Shows usage of ADC APIs

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
