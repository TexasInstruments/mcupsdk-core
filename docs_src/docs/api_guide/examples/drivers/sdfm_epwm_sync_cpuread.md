In this example, SDFM filter data is read by CPU in SDFM ISR routine. The
SDFM configuration is shown below:
 -  SDFM used in this example - SDFM0
 -  Input control mode selected - MODE0
 -  Comparator settings
      - Sinc3 filter selected
      - OSR = 32
      - HLT = 0x7FFF (Higher threshold setting)
      - LLT  = 0x0000(Lower threshold setting)
 -  Data filter settings
     - All the 4 filter modules enabled
     - Sinc3 filter selected
     - OSR = 256
     - All the 4 filters are synchronized by using PWM
     - Filter output represented in 16 bit format
     - In order to convert 25 bit Data filter
       into 16 bit format user needs to right shift by 10 bits for
       Sinc3 filter with OSR = 256
 - Interrupt module settings for SDFM filter
     - All the 4 higher threshold comparator interrupts disabled
     - All the 4 lower threshold comparator interrupts disabled
     - All the 4 modulator failure interrupts disabled
     - All the 4 filter will generate interrupt when a new filter data
       is available.

EPWM1 SOCA is used to synchronize all four filters.
All 4 filters use SD1 (Filter1) clock.

EPWM0_B is used to generated a optional SDFM clock.

Watch  Variables
-   filter1Result - Output of filter 1
-   filter2Result - Output of filter 2
-   filter3Result - Output of filter 3
-   filter4Result - Output of filter 4

# External Connections
-  Connect Sigma-Delta streams to
SDFM0_CLK0, SDFM0_D0,
SDFM0_D1,
SDFM0_D2,
SDFM0_D3

## AM263X-CC
When using AM263x-CC with TMDSHSECDOCK (HSEC180 controlCARD Baseboard Docking Station)
-  Connect Sigma-Delta data streams to

HSEC Pin 91  (SDFM0_D0),
HSEC Pin 99  (SDFM0_D1),
HSEC Pin 103 (SDFM0_D2),
HSEC Pin 107 (SDFM0_D3).

-  Connect Sigma-Delta clock to

HSEC Pin 72 (SDFM0_CLK0)

Alternate option: Use PWM waveform generated by AM263x as clock. Connect HSEC Pin 51 (Clock generated by EPWM0_B) to HSEC Pin 72

## AM263X-LP
This example is not supported on AM263X-LP

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Establish connections as mentioned in External Connections section
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- View the UART console logs for results
