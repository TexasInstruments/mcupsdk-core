# EQEP frequency measurement {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_EQEP_FREQUENCY_MEASUREMENT}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example uses the EQEP to measure frequency of a signal generated by ePWM.

The example does the below
- Configures EPWM to generate a signal and EQEP to measure frequency of this generated signal (a loopback connection is required).
- The application runs for the specified time and the frequency calculation is done using the EPWM ISR.
- After the specified time, the application checks if the measured frequency was within range of the generated frequency.

# External connections

- Connect eQEP0A to ePWM0A (simulates eQEP Phase A signal)
- Connect eQEP0B to ePWM0B (simulates eQEP Phase B signal)
- Connect eQEP0I to GPIO48 (simulates eQEP Index Signal)
## AM263X-CC

When using AM263x-CC with TMDSHSECDOCK (HSEC180 controlCARD Baseboard Docking Station)
- Connect HSEC Pin 49 to HSEC Pin 102 (simulates eQEP Phase A signal)
- Connect HSEC Pin 51 to HSEC Pin 100 (simulates eQEP Phase B signal)
- Connect HSEC Pin 106 to HSEC Pin 52 (simulates eQEP Index Signal)

## AM263X-LP
- Connect eQEP2A (J25 Pin 1) to ePWM0A (J2/J4 Pin 11) (simulates eQEP Phase A signal)
- Connect eQEP2B (J25 Pin 2) to ePWM0B (J6/J8 Pin 59) (simulates eQEP Phase B signal)
- Connect eQEP2I (J25 Pin 3) to GPIO48 (J2/J4 Pin 40) (simulates eQEP Index Signal)

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Establish connections as mentioned in External Connections section
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- View the UART console logs for results
