# EPWM UP-COUNT ACTION QUALIFIER {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_EPWM_UP_AQ}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example configures ePWM0, ePWM1 and ePWM2 to produce an waveform with independent modulation on ePWMxA and ePWMxB. The TB counter is in up count mode for this example.

The compare values CMPA and CMPB are modified within the ePWM's ISR.

## ISR Configuration
1. INTXbar0, INTXbar1 and INTXbar2 are set for EPWM0INT, EPWM1INT and EPWM2INT
2. App_epwmIntrISR_x service this interrupts
    - Updates the CMPA and CMPB compare values at every 10'th interrupt as follows:
        - If CMPA/B is incrising, check if it reached max value. If not, increase CMPA/B else, change direction and decrease CMPA/B
        - If CMPA/B is decrising, check if it reached min value. If not, decrease CMPA/B else, change direction and increase CMPA/B
