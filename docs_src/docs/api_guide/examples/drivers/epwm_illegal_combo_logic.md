# EPWM Illegal Combo Logic {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_EPWM_ILLEGAL_COMBO_LOGIC}

[TOC]

# Introduction

The purpose of the example is to show some of the operations that can be done using ICL.
We can route a signal of EPWM instance through some other EPWM instance without even configuring the latter.
We use ICLXBar along with the ICL block functionalities provided inside each instance to get the desired results.

# Various ICL configurations

The screenshots attached in the documentation are as per the results obtained by executing the example on CC. Please note that there are some instance differences between CC and LP.

The mapping is such that:

\cond SOC_AM263X
EPWM0A(B) on CC <--> EPWM0A(B) on LP   \n
EPWM1A    on CC <--> EPWM1A on LP      \n

EPWM3A(B) on CC <--> EPWM3A(B) on LP   \n
EPWM4A(B) on CC <--> EPWM9A(B) on LP   \n
EPWM5A(B) on CC <--> EPWM11A(B) on LP  \n

## XOR and XNOR

Here, we configure EPWM3 with some TBPRD, CMPA and CMPB values and define some actions on each event.
Since no MDL functions are performed, so the signal coming out of AQ submodule is what comes out of MDL blocks A and B respectively.
They are then routed through separate ICLXBARs.

\imageStyle{am263_epwm_icl_xor_xnor_connection.PNG,width:60%}
 \image html am263_epwm_icl_xor_xnor_connection.PNG "Figure 1.a Xbar connectivity for ICL"

In EPWM4, we can define the combo logic. As IN3 gets its input from ICLXBARs, to output the same signal we can define the truth table as

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
0                  | X                 | X                     | 0
1                  | X                 | X                     | 1

Inside EPWM3, for ICL Block A we need to put logic such that Output = IN1 xor IN2; where IN1 gets EPWM3A_MDL and IN2 gets EPWMxB_MDL.
Similarly for ICL Block B, output = IN1 xnor IN2; where IN1 gets EPWMxB_MDL and IN2 gets EPWM3A_MDL.

For ICL block A,

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
X                  | 0                 | 0                     | 0
X                  | 0                 | 1                     | 1
X                  | 1                 | 0                     | 1
X                  | 1                 | 1                     | 0

For ICL block B,

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
X                  | 0                 | 0                     | 1
X                  | 0                 | 1                     | 0
X                  | 1                 | 0                     | 0
X                  | 1                 | 1                     | 1

## NAND and NOR

Here, we configure EPWM5A with some TBPRD, CMPA and CMPB values and define some actions on each event.
Since no MDL functions are performed, so the signal coming out of AQ submodule is what comes out of MDL blocks A and B respectively.

They are then routed through separate ICLXBARs.

In EPWM6, we can define the combo logic. As IN3 gets its input from ICLXBARs, to output the same signal we can define the truth table as

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
0                  | X                 | X                     | 0
1                  | X                 | X                     | 1

Inside EPWM5, for ICL Block A we need to put logic such that Output = IN1 nand IN2; where IN1 gets EPWM5A_MDL and IN2 gets EPWMxB_MDL.
Similarly for ICL Block B, output = IN1 nor IN2; where IN1 gets EPWMxB_MDL and IN2 gets EPWM5A_MDL.

For ICL block A,

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
X                  | 0                 | 0                     | 1
X                  | 0                 | 1                     | 1
X                  | 1                 | 0                     | 1
X                  | 1                 | 1                     | 0

For ICL block B,

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
X                  | 0                 | 0                     | 1
X                  | 0                 | 1                     | 0
X                  | 1                 | 0                     | 0
X                  | 1                 | 1                     | 0

## Both NOT HIGH at the same time

EPWM0 is configured such that when TripIN gets HIGH, then it pulls EPWM0A to high.
Here the EPWM0A_MDL has been routed through EPWM2 in the same process as mentioned in the above cases.
EPWM2B shows how EPWM0B was before ICL was applied to it.
The ICL for block B inside EPWM0 was configured such that EPWM0A and EPWM0B cannot be high at the same time. So whenever EPWM0A_MDL gets pulled because of the trip, the EPWM0B should be pulled down.
Since ICL Block A is disabled, EPWM0A_MDL will go as the final output.

 \image html am263_epwm_icl_both_not_high_connection.PNG "Figure 3.a Connection between EPWMs"

For ICL Block B, the truth table will be like:

IN3                | IN2               | IN1                   | Force
-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------
X                  | 0                 | 0                     | 0 (IN1)
X                  | 0                 | 1                     | 1 (IN1)
X                  | 1                 | 0                     | 0 (IN1)
X                  | 1                 | 1                     | 0 (both cannot be high, so pull this low)
