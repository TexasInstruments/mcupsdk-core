# DAC Square wave {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_DAC_SQUARE_WAVE}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example uses the DAC to generate a square wave on the DAC output.

The example does the below
- Repeatedly configures the minimum and maximum value in the DAC Shadow register after specified time intervals.
- This repeated programming of the registers generates a square wave.
- Sets the output voltage back to 0.

# External Connections
- DAC output pin can be connected to an oscilloscope to view the square wave output.

## AM263X-CC
Note: To use the reference voltage generated on ControlCard, make sure that the System VREF source select switch SW8 on ControlCard is set to position 1-2

When using AM263x-CC with TMDSHSECDOCK (HSEC180 controlCARD Baseboard Docking Station)
- Capture waveform on HSEC Pin 9

## AM263X-LP
Note: To use the reference voltage generated on LaunchPad, make sure that the DAC_VREF source select switch S1 on LaunchPad is set to position 1-2

With AM263X-LP
- Capture the waveform on boosterpack header J1/J3 Pin 30

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Establish connections as mentioned in External Connections section
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- Use an Oscilloscope to view the square wave on DAC output pin.
