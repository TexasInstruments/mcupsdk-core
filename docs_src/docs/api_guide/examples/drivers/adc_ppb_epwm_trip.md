# ADC PPB EPWM Trip {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_ADC_PPB_EPWM_TRIP}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example demonstrates EPWM tripping through ADC limit detection PPB block. ADC0INT1 is
configured to periodically trigger the ADC0 channel 2 post initial software forced trigger. The limit
detection post-processing block(PPB) is configured and if the ADC results are outside of the defined
range, the post-processing block will generate an ADCxEVTy event. This event is configured as
EPWM trip source through configuring EPWM XBAR and corresponding EPWMâ€™s trip zone and
digital compare sub-modules. The example showcases one-shot, cycle-by-cycle and direct tripping of
PWMs through ADCAEVT1 source via Digital compare submodule.
DAC is configured to generate a ramp waveform and its output is connected as ADC input. PWM tripping is
validated by reading different trip flags.

\note
The ADC EVT routing the Outputxbar in AM263x is missing. Hence in order to bring the ADC EVT to GPIO, we can follow other routes such as routing.
1. ADC EVT is typically paired usage with Tripping the EPWMs. We can route the ADC EVT to PWMxbar, to DCEVT(A/B)(1/2) to Trip Zone TripOut to Outputxbar. Note that it can be a OST or CBC, but then the ADCEVT is now latched instead of its actual status. So, forward the DCEVT(A/B)(1/2) as is to the tripzone. The example showcases this routing.

The example does the below
- Configures SOC0 of ADC0 to read from Channel 2 and ADC0INT1 to periodically trigger conversions after the initial software forced trigger.
- ADC PPB is configured to generate ADC EVT1 if ADC results are outside the range.
- ADC Event is configured as EPWM trip source through EPWM XBAR.
- Trip Zone and Digital Compare submodule are configured to enable different trip combinations.
- EPWM0 (EPWM2 in case of AM261x-LP) is configured for One Shot trip.
- EPWM1 (EPWM3 in case of AM261x-LP) is configured for Cycle by Cycle trip.
- EPWM2 (EPWM4 in case of AM261x-LP) is configured for Direct trip via Digital compare submodule.
- The ramp waveform on DAC output is routed to ADC input.
- The watch variables storing ADC conversion outputs can be used to view the results.
- ADC EVT is routed via OutputXbar to GPIO

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Establish connections as mentioned in External Connections section
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- Using the watch variables, view the ADC conversion results.
- Observe 6 EPWM waveforms. After ADC input voltage exceeds the PPB limit, PWMs get tripped.
