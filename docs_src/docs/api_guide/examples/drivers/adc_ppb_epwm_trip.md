# ADC PPB EPWM Trip {#EXAMPLES_DRIVERS_ADC_PPB_EPWM_TRIP}

# Introduction

This example demonstrates EPWM tripping through ADC limit detection PPB block. ADC0INT1 is
configured to periodically trigger the ADC0 channel 2 post initial software forced trigger. The limit
detection post-processing block(PPB) is configured and if the ADC results are outside of the defined
range, the post-processing block will generate an ADCxEVTy event. This event is configured as
EPWM trip source through configuring EPWM XBAR and corresponding EPWMâ€™s trip zone and
digital compare sub-modules. The example showcases one-shot, cycle-by-cycle and direct tripping of
PWMs through ADCAEVT1 source via Digital compare submodule.
DAC is configured to generate a ramp waveform and its output is connected as ADC input. PWM tripping is
validated by reading different trip flags.

The example does the below
- Configures SOC0 of ADC0 to read from Channel 2 and ADC0INT1 to periodically trigger conversions after the initial software forced trigger.
- ADC PPB is configured to generate ADC EVT1 if ADC results are outside the range.
- ADC Event is configured as EPWM trip source through EPWM XBAR.
- Trip Zone and Digital Compare submodule are configured to enable different trip combinations.
- EPWM0 is configured for One Shot trip.
- EPWM1 is configured for Cycle by Cycle trip.
- EPWM2 is configured for Direct trip via Digital compare submodule.
- The ramp waveform on DAC output is routed to ADC input.
- The watch variables storing ADC conversion outputs can be used to view the results.

Watch  Variables
- adc0Result2 - Digital representation of the voltage on pin ADC0_AIN2

# External Connections
- ADC0_AIN2 pin should be connected to DAC output pin.
- EPWM0A, EPWM0B, EPWM1A, EPWM1B, EPWM2A, EPWM2B can be connected to an oscilloscope to validate tripping.

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Establish connections as mentioned in External Connections section
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
- Using the watch variables, view the ADC conversion results.
- Observe 6 EPWM waveforms. After ADC input voltage exceeds the PPB limit, PWMs get tripped.
