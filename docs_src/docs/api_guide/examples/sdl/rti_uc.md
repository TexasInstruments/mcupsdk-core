# SDL RTI {#EXAMPLES_SDL_RTI}

[TOC]

# Introduction

The following shows an example of SDL RTI API usage by the application to set up the RTI as a watchdog and usage of the various APIs.
Events can be monitored by enabling the events in the associated ESM instance.
Use Cases
---------
 Use Case | Description
 ---------|------------
 UC-1     |WINDOWSIZE_100_PERCENT
 UC-2     |WINDOWSIZE_50_PERCENT
 UC-3     |Latency/Propagation timing error(early)(50% window)
 UC-4     |Latency/Propagation timing error(late)(50% window)

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
