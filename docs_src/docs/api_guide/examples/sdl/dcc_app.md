# SDL DCC Example {#EXAMPLES_SDL_DCC}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example demonstrates how to configure the DCC and use it to monitor clocks in the two supported modes (continuous and single-shot modes). It also demonstrates how to receive errors generated by DCC in the MCU and Main domain.

This example displays:

    * Initializing the ESM to detect the DCC error event(s)
    * Registration of application callback for notification of ESM error events for the MCU ESM instance
    * Configuration of one MCU DCC instance to monitor a single clock in continuous mode
    * Forcing of an error to create a DCC error event

The following methods can be used as a trigger for the DCC error event:

    * Change ratio criterion for stable clocks
    * Use Sciclient API to change clock dividers (with ratio criterion stable) to speed up clock
    * Use Sciclient API to change clock dividers (with ratio criterion stable) to slow down clock
    * Turn off power for the monitored input clock

# Steps to Run the Example

- **When using CCS projects to build**, import the CCS project for the required combination
  and build it using the CCS project menu (see \ref CCS_PROJECTS_PAGE).
- **When using makefiles to build**, note the required combination and build using
  make command (see \ref MAKEFILE_BUILD_PAGE)
- Launch a CCS debug session and run the executable, see \ref CCS_LAUNCH_PAGE
