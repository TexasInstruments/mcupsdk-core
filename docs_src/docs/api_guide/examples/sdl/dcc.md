# SDL DCC Example {#EXAMPLES_SDL_DCC}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This example demonstrates how to configure the DCC and use it to monitor clocks in the two supported modes (continuous and single-shot modes). It also demonstrates how to receive errors generated by DCC in the DSP and Main domain.


\cond SOC_AWR294X || SOC_AM263X || SOC_AM263PX
This example displays:

    * Initializing the ESM to detect the DCC error event(s)
    * Registration of application callback for notification of ESM error events for the MSS ESM instance
    * Configuration of one MSS DCC instance to monitor a single clock in continuous mode
    * Forcing of an error to create a DCC error event
\endcond
The following methods can be used as a trigger for the DCC error event:

    * Change ratio criterion for stable clocks
    * Turn off power for the monitored input clock
