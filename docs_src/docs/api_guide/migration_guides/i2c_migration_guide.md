# I2C Migration Guide {#I2C_MIGRATION_GUIDE}

This section describes the differences between I2C APIs of MCU+ SDK and Processor SDK RTOS (PDK).
This can be used as a migration aid when moving from Processor SDK RTOS (PDK) to MCU+ SDK.

In MCU+ SDK, the I2C module provides higher level driver APIs.Refer \ref DRIVERS_I2C_PAGE for more details.

## API changes

There are changes in functions names, structure names and macro names. The changes in function names are listed below.

    <tr>
        <td>I2C_control
        <td>None
        <td>In MCU+SDK, this API is separated into 3 sub APIs. I2C_probe, I2C_setBusFrequency and I2C_recoverBus.
    </tr>

## Important Notes

- In MCU+ SDK, Users are recommended to use SysConfig to configure driver parameters as this will greatly simplify the task of driver configuration.
