# By default this config file,
# - points to pre-built flash writer, bootloader for this EVM
# - The application image points to relative path of the ipc echo application image for this EVM
#   - Make sure this application is built before running this script
# - You can customized this config file to point to your own bootloader and/or application images
# - You can use --operation=flashverify if you just want to verify the flash contents and not flash the file.
#

# First point to sbl_uart_uniflash binary, which function's as a server to flash one or more files
--flash-writer=sbl_prebuilt/am273x-evm/sbl_uart_uniflash.release.tiimage

# Now send one or more files to flash or flashverify as needed. The order of sending files does not matter

# When sending bootloader make sure to flash at offset 0x0. ROM expects bootloader at offset 0x0
--file=sbl_prebuilt/am273x-evm/sbl_qspi.release.tiimage --operation=flash --flash-offset=0x0

# send the application image to flash. Flash it at 0xA0000 as the SBL expects it at this location
--file=../../examples/hello_world/am273x-evm/r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang/hello_world.release.appimage --operation=flash --flash-offset=0xA0000
